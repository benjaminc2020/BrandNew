               <li>Back in school they never taught us what we needed to know,</li>
               
               <li>like how to deal with despair, or someone breaking your heart.</li>
               
               <li>For twelve years I've held it all together but a night like this is begging to pull me
                  apart.</li>
               
               <li>I played it quiet, left you deep in conversation.</li>
               
               <li>I felt uncool and hung out around the kitchen.</li>
               
               <li>I remember I kept thinking that I know you never would,</li>
               
               <li>and now I know I want to kill you like only a best friend could.</li>
