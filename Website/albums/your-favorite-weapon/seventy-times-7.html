                  <li>Back in <span class="school">school</span> they never <span class="school" >taught</span> us what we needed to know,</li>
                  <li>like how to deal with despair, or someone <span class="idiom">breaking your heart</span>.</li>
                  <li>For twelve <span class="time">years</span> I've <span class="idiom">held it all together</span> but a <span class="time">night</span> like this is begging to <span class="idiom">pull me apart</span>.</li>
                  <li>I played it quiet, left you deep in conversation.</li>
                  <li>I felt uncool and hung out around the <span class="house">kitchen</span>.</li>
                  <li>I remember I kept thinking that I know you never would,</li>
                  <li>and now I know I want to <span class="death">kill</span> you like only a best friend could.</li>

                  <li>Ignore the sun, the cover's over my head.</li>
                  <li>I wrote a message on my <span class="bed">pillow</span> that says, "<span class="bandMember">Jesse</span>, stay <span class="bed">asleep in bed</span>."</li>
                  <li>So don't apologize. I hope you choke and die.</li>
                  <li>Search your cell for something with which to <span class="death">hang yourself</span>.</li>
