<lyrics>[Verse 1]
Goodbye to sleep
I think that staying up is exactly what I need
Well take apart your head
Take apart the counting
And the flock it has bred
Goodbye to love
It’s just a ride that will push you up
Right against the wall (Does everybody really need to know everyone?)
Take apart your head
Do you really think you’re really a part of it?
Right against the wall
And is your army really one of some thousands?
Chew it up and swallow it
And will you declare war on the loony bin?

[Chorus]
But I'll bet that you're running
I've been sleeping on the incline
I can't shake this little feeling
I'll never get anything right

[Verse 2]
Goodbye, you liar
Well, you sipped from the cup
But you don't own up to anything
Then you think you will inspire
Take apart your head (I wish I could inspire)
Take apart the demon, in the attic, to the left

[Chorus 2]
(Goodbye my love)
But I'll bet that you're running
(Goodbye my love)
I've been sleeping on the incline
(Goodbye my love)
I can't shake this little feeling
(Goodbye my love)

[Bridge]
I never say anything right (I'm on my own)
I never say anything right (I'm on my own)
I never say anything right (I'm on my own)
I never say anything right, right, right (I'm on my own)

[Verse 3]
Take me, take me, back to your bed
I love you so much that it hurts my head
Say "I don't mind you under my skin,"
Oh, let the bad parts in, the bad parts in
When we were made, we were set apart
Life is a test and I get bad marks
Now some Saint got the job
Of writing down my sins
The storm is coming
The storm is coming in

[Chorus 3]
But I'll bet that you're running
I've been sleeping in the alkaline
I can't shake this little feeling
I never did anything right (I'm on my own)
I never did anything right (I'm on my own)

[Outro]
Take me, take me back to your bed
I love you so much, that it hurts my head
Say, I don't mind you under my skin
Oh, let the bad parts in, the bad parts in
You're my favorite bird, and when you sing
I really do wish you would wear my ring
No matter what they say, I am still the king
Now, the storm is coming
The storm is coming in
