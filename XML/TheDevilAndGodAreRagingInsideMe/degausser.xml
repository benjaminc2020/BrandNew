        <verse>
            <line>Goodbye to sleep</line>
            <line>I think that staying up is exactly what I need</line>
            <line>Well take apart your head</line>
            <line>Take apart the counting</line>
            <line>And the flock it has bred</line>
            <line>Goodbye to love</line>
            <line>It’s just a ride that will push you up</line>
            <line>Right against the wall (Does everybody really need to know everyone?)</line>
            <line>Take apart your head</line>
            <line>Do you really think you’re really a part of it?</line>
            <line>Right against the wall</line>
            <line>And is your army really one of some thousands?</line>
            <line>Chew it up and swallow it</line>
            <line>And will you declare war on the loony bin?</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>But I'll bet that you're running</line>
            <line>I've been sleeping on the incline</line>
            <line>I can't shake this little feeling</line>
            <line>I'll never get anything right</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse>
            <line>Goodbye, you liar</line>
            <line>Well, you sipped from the cup</line>
            <line>But you don't own up to anything</line>
            <line>Then you think you will inspire</line>
            <line>Take apart your head (I wish I could inspire)</line>
            <line>Take apart the demon, in the attic, to the left</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>(Goodbye my love)</line>
            <line>But I'll bet that you're running</line>
            <line>(Goodbye my love)</line>
            <line>I've been sleeping on the incline</line>
            <line>(Goodbye my love)</line>
            <line>I can't shake this little feeling</line>
            <line>(Goodbye my love)</line>
        </chorus>
        <bridge>
            <line>I never say anything right (I'm on my own)</line>
            <line>I never say anything right (I'm on my own)</line>
            <line>I never say anything right (I'm on my own)</line>
            <line>I never say anything right, right, right (I'm on my own)</line>
        </bridge>
        <verse>
            <line>Take me, take me, back to your bed</line>
            <line>I love you so much that it hurts my head</line>
            <line>Say "I don't mind you under my skin,"</line>
            <line>Oh, let the bad parts in, the bad parts in</line>
            <line>When we were made, we were set apart</line>
            <line>Life is a test and I get bad marks</line>
            <line>Now some Saint got the job</line>
            <line>Of writing down my sins</line>
            <line>The storm is coming</line>
            <line>The storm is coming in</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>But I'll bet that you're running</line>
            <line>I've been sleeping in the alkaline</line>
            <line>I can't shake this little feeling</line>
            <line>I never did anything right (I'm on my own)</line>
            <line>I never did anything right (I'm on my own)</line>
        </chorus>
        <outro>
            <line>Take me, take me back to your bed</line>
            <line>I love you so much, that it hurts my head</line>
            <line>Say, I don't mind you under my skin</line>
            <line>Oh, let the bad parts in, the bad parts in</line>
            <line>You're my favorite bird, and when you sing</line>
            <line>I really do wish you would wear my ring</line>
            <line>No matter what they say, I am still the king</line>
            <line>Now, the storm is coming</line>
            <line>The storm is coming in</line>
