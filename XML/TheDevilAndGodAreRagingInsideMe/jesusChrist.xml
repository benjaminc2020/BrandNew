<lyrics>
            [Verse 1]
            Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face
            The kind you'd find on someone that could save
            If they don't put me away
            Well, it’ll be a miracle
            Do you believe you're missing out?
            That everything good is happening somewhere else
            But with nobody in your bed
            The night's hard to get through
            
            [Chorus 1]
            And I will die all alone
            And when I arrive I won’t know anyone
            
            [Verse 2]
            Well, Jesus Christ, I’m alone again
            So what did you do those three days you were dead?
            Because this problem's gonna last
            More than the weekend
            Well, Jesus Christ, I’m not scared to die
            But I’m a little bit scared of what comes after
            Do I get the gold chariot?
            Do I float through the ceiling?
            
            [Chorus 2]
            Do I divide and pull apart?
            'Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark
            And this ship went down in sight of land
            And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands?
            
            [Bridge]
            I know you're coming in the night like a thief
            But I’ve had some time, O Lord, to hone my lying technique
            I know you think that I’m someone you can trust
            But I’m scared I’ll get scared and I swear I’ll try to nail you back up
            So do you think that we could work out a sign
            So I’ll know it's you and that it's over so I won't even try
            I know you're coming for the people like me
            But we all got wood and nails
            And we turn out hate in factories
            We all got wood and nails
            And we turn out hate in factories
            We all got wood and nails
            And we sleep inside of this machine
            
            [Outro]
