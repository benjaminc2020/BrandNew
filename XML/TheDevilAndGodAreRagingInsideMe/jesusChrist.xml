    <lyrics>
        <verse>
            <line>Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face</line>
            <line>The kind you'd find on someone that could save</line>
            <line>If they don't put me away</line>
            <line>Well, it’ll be a miracle</line>
            <line>Do you believe you're missing out?</line>
            <line>That everything good is happening somewhere else</line>
            <line>But with nobody in your bed</line>
            <line>The night's hard to get through</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>And I will die all alone</line>
            <line>And when I arrive I won’t know anyone</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse>
            <line>Well, Jesus Christ, I’m alone again</line>
            <line>So what did you do those three days you were dead?</line>
            <line>Because this problem's gonna last</line>
            <line>More than the weekend</line>
            <line>Well, Jesus Christ, I’m not scared to die</line>
            <line>But I’m a little bit scared of what comes after</line>
            <line>Do I get the gold chariot?</line>
            <line>Do I float through the ceiling?</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>Do I divide and pull apart?</line> 'Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all
            my dark <line>And this ship went down in sight of land</line>
            <line>And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands?</line>
        </chorus>
        <bridge>
            <line>I know you're coming in the night like a thief</line>
            <line>But I’ve had some time, O Lord, to hone my lying technique</line>
            <line>I know you think that I’m someone you can trust</line>
            <line>But I’m scared I’ll get scared and I swear I’ll try to nail you back up</line>
            <line>So do you think that we could work out a sign</line>
            <line>So I’ll know it's you and that it's over so I won't even try</line>
            <line>I know you're coming for the people like me</line>
            <line>But we all got wood and nails</line>
            <line>And we turn out hate in factories</line>
            <line>We all got wood and nails</line>
            <line>And we turn out hate in factories</line>
            <line>We all got wood and nails</line>
            <line>And we sleep inside of this machine</line>
        </bridge>
