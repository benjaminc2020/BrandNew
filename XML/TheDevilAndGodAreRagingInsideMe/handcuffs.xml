<lyrics>
    [Verse 1]
    I'd arrest you if I had handcuffs
    I'd arrest you if I had the time
    I'd throw you down in the backseat
    As if you committed a terrible crime
    
    I'd break into towns worth of houses
    And rob whole families blind
    I'd do it to you like you'd do it to me
    If I knew you would get away fine
    
    I'd drown all these crying babies
    If I knew that their mothers wouldn't cry
    I'd hold them down and I'd squeeze real soft
    And let a piece of myself die
    
    [Chorus]
    It's hard to be the better man
    When you forget you're tryin'
    It's hard to be the better man
    
    [Verse 2]
    I'd arrest you if I had handcuffs
    I'd arrest you if I had the time
    I'd wait for you outside the courtroomâ€”and taunt you
    As all of your appeals were declined
    
    I'd drive my car off of the bridge
    If I knew that you weren't inside
    Put the pedal to the floor, who could ask for more?
    A fantastic way to kill some time
    
    You could lay on your back and be beaten
    You could put up your fists and fight
    You could try any way out
    Way out
    Way out
    Way out
    
    [Chorus]
    It's hard to be the better man
    When you forget you're tryin'
    It's hard to be the better man
    When you're still lyin'
    
    It's hard to be the better man
    When you forget you're tryin'
    It's hard to be the better man
    When you're still lyin'
    You're still lyin'
