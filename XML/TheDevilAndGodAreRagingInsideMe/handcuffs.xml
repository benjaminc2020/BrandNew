        <verse>
            <line>I'd arrest you if I had handcuffs</line>
            <line>I'd arrest you if I had the time</line>
            <line>I'd throw you down in the backseat</line>
            <line>As if you committed a terrible crime</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>I'd break into towns worth of houses</line>
            <line>And rob whole families blind</line>
            <line>I'd do it to you like you'd do it to me</line>
            <line>If I knew you would get away fine</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>I'd drown all these crying babies</line>
            <line>If I knew that their mothers wouldn't cry</line>
            <line>I'd hold them down and I'd squeeze real soft</line>
            <line>And let a piece of myself die</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>It's hard to be the better man</line>
            <line>When you forget you're tryin'</line>
            <line>It's hard to be the better man</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse>
            <line>I'd arrest you if I had handcuffs</line>
            <line>I'd arrest you if I had the time</line>
            <line>I'd wait for you outside the courtroomâ€”and taunt you</line>
            <line>As all of your appeals were declined</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>I'd drive my car off of the bridge</line>
            <line>If I knew that you weren't inside</line>
            <line>Put the pedal to the floor, who could ask for more?</line>
            <line>A fantastic way to kill some time</line>
        </verse>
        <bridge>
            <line>You could lay on your back and be beaten</line>
            <line>You could put up your fists and fight</line>
            <line>You could try any way out</line>
            <line>Way out</line>
            <line>Way out</line>
            <line>Way out</line>
        </bridge>
        <chorus>
            <line>It's hard to be the better man</line>
            <line>When you forget you're tryin'</line>
            <line>It's hard to be the better man</line>
            <line>When you're still lyin'</line>
        </chorus>
        <chorus>
            <line>It's hard to be the better man</line>
            <line>When you forget you're tryin'</line>
            <line>It's hard to be the better man</line>
            <line>When you're still lyin'</line>
            <line>You're still lyin'</line>
