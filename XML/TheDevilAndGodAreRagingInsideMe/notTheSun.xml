    [Verse 1]
    Please don't be technology
    So I can turn off your love like some cold machine
    Don't feed me scraps from your bed
    I won't be the stray comin' back just to be fed
    
    Don't be waves, come and seal my fate marine
    Just pretend that you want me
    
    [Chorus]
    And be my babe, be my babe
    Be my babe, be my babe
    Be my babe, be my babe
    Be my babe, be my babe
    Be my—
    
    [Verse 2]
    Well, don't be that note I can't hold
    Well, don't be that joke that I told and told till it got old
    Don't be that hand 'round my throat so I can't breathe
    Say you're my friend but why won't you be my family?
    
    And if you breed, just don't tell me
    
    [Chorus]
    
    And be my babe, be my babe
    Be my babe, be my babe
    Be my babe, be my babe
    Be my babe, be my babe
    Be my babe, be my babe
    Be my babe, be my babe
    Be my babe, be my babe
    Be my babe, be my babe	 
    
    
    
    We will celebrate, but we’ve gone faster we’ll have our harmonies, wanting quick slaughter and would you want me? For the millionth time I’ve said it time and time again
    [Bridge]
    Be my serene
    Tell me you know what I mean
    You've set on me
    But you are not the sun
    You are not the sun
    
    Outside, I'm growin' roots again
    You set on me
    But you are not the sun
    You are not the sun
    You are not the sun	 
    
    Prove me wrong
    
    
    How do they know
    What I am?
    Burn it down
    Come around
    So let's pretend that you love me
    
    [Chorus]
    And be my babe, be my babe
    Be my babe, be my babe
    Be my babe, be my babe
    Be my babe, be my babe
    Be my—
