[Verse 1]
When I disappear, do you fear for the sister I took?
When I disappear, it is clear I am up to no good
I am drearily bloodletting this bedwetting cosmonaut
"Son, the last thing you'll realize you need is what you've already got"

[Hook]
So touch me or don’t
Just let me know
Where you’ve been

[Verse 2]

Please drop me a line with a hook and some raw bleeding bait

For I am uncaught and still swimming alone in the lake

Shimmering under a moon
made in anger and haste
Shimmering like a penny
out of reach in the
subway grating	 

1 2 3 4


5 6 7 8


Shimmering like a coin kept safe away
You never listen to anything
[Hook]
We could leave it alone
I’m sure there’s someone who knows
Where you’ve been

[Verse 3]
"You could never work well with our group
Not with the faults we've found
So we've fixed you with cement galoshes
And no one can save you now
Unless you have friends among fish
There’ll still be no air to breathe
You could drink up the entire ocean
We’ll still find someone to be everything
We know that you’ll never be"

[Hook]
So touch me or don’t
Just let me know—
Where you been?

Or we could leave it alone
I’m sure there’s someone who knows
Where you’ve been</lyrics>
