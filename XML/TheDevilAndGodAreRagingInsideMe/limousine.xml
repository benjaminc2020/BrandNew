    <lyrics>
        <verse>
            <line>Kate, it's your ride</line>
            <line>Get your petals out and lay them in the aisle</line>
            <line>Pretend you're God and grow, and it’s your day to wed</line>
            <line>We found your man, he's drinking up, he's All-American</line>
            <line>And he'll drive</line>
            <line>He's volunteered with grace to end your life</line>
            <line>He'll tidy up</line>
            <line>It's sad to hold, but leave your shell to us</line>
            <line>You explode</line>
            <line>You firefly, you tiny boat with oars</line>
            <line>Feather oars. The world tilts back and pours and pours</line>
            <line>And so, you satellite</line>
            <line>You tidal wave, you're a big surprise</line>
            <line>And I've one more night to be your mother</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>The signal interrupted</line>
            <line>My baby's frequency not strong enough</line>
            <line>Remain in my hands and smile</line>
            <line>We will miss you but in time you'll get set up</line>
            <line>And we will write</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>A beauty supreme, yeah you were right about me</line>
            <line>Can I get myself out from underneath this guilt that will crush me</line>
            <line>And in the choir I saw a sad messiah</line>
            <line>He was bored and tired of my laments</line>
            <line>Said, "I died for you one time but never again"</line>
