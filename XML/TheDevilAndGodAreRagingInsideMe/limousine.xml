<lyrics>
            [Verse 1]
            Kate, it's your ride
            Get your petals out and lay them in the aisle
            Pretend you're God and grow, and it’s your day to wed
            We found your man, he's drinking up, he's All-American
            And he'll drive
            He's volunteered with grace to end your life
            He'll tidy up
            It's sad to hold, but leave your shell to us
            You explode
            You firefly, you tiny boat with oars
            Feather oars. The world tilts back and pours and pours
            And so, you satellite
            You tidal wave, you're a big surprise
            And I've one more night to be your mother
            
            [Chorus]
            The signal interrupted
            My baby's frequency not strong enough
            Remain in my hands and smile
            We will miss you but in time you'll get set up
            And we will write
            
            [Verse 2]
            A beauty supreme, yeah you were right about me
            Can I get myself out from underneath this guilt that will crush me
            And in the choir I saw a sad messiah
            He was bored and tired of my laments
            Said, "I died for you one time but never again"
            Never again
            Never again
            Never again
            Never again
            Never again
            Never again
            Never again
            Well I love you so much (never again)
            But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (never again)
            'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it (never again)
            
            Well I love you so much
            Never again
            But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
            Never again
            'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it
            Never again
            
            One'll love you so much
            Never again
            But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
            Never again
            'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it
            Never again
            
            Two'll love you so much
            Never again
            But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
            Never again
            'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it
            Never again
            
            Three'll love you so much
            Never again
            But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
            Never again
            'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it
            Never again
            
            Four'll love you so much
            Never again
            But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
            Never again
            'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it
            Never again
            
            Five'll love you so much
            Never again
            But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
            Never again
            'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it
            Never again
            
            Six'll love you so much
            Never again
            But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
            Never again
            'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it
            Never again
            
            Seven loves you so much
            Never again
            But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
            Never again
            'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it
            Never again
            
            Seven loved you so much
            We'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth
            But do me a favor
            We'll never have to rot together under the dirt
            Baby, don't reply
            I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd
            'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it
            Well I should be laughing right now
            Seven loved you so much
            We'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth
            But do me a favor
            We'll never have to rot together under the dirt
            Baby, don't reply
            I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd
            'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it
            Well I should be laughing right now
            
            [Instrumental]
            
            [Outro]
            I don't know what's going on—maybe you could fill me in about the recording
