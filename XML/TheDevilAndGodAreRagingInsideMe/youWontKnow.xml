        <verse>
            <line>Hey hey hey! Mr. Hangman</line>
            <line>Go get your rope</line>
            <line>Your daughters weren't careful</line>
            <line>I fear that I am a slippery slope</line>
            <line>Now even if I lay my head down at night</line>
            <line>After a day I got perfectly right</line>
            <line>She won't know</line>
            <line>She won't know</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>So pray, Little Kay, love is just God on a good day</line>
            <line>And you can't blame your mother</line>
            <line>She's trying not to see you as her worst mistake</line>
            <line>And I wish that I could tell you right now</line>
            <line>I love you</line>
            <line>But it looks like I won't be around</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>So you won't know</line>
            <line>You won't know</line>
            <line>You won't know</line>
            <line>You won't know</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse>
            <line>So believe in me, believe them</line>
            <line>You think I'll let you down?</line>
            <line>Well I won't</line>
            <line>They can fire everything they've got</line>
            <line>And when you think I'm sunk</line>
            <line>I will float on and on</line>
            <line>I have burned the bush that covered my light</line>
            <line>Even though I’m scared I won’t burn as bright</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>You won't know</line>
            <line>You won't know</line>
            <line>You won't know</line>
            <line>You won't know</line>
        </chorus>
        <bridge>
            <line>You're never going to feel as full as you felt</line>
            <line>So let's go outside and we'll play William Tell</line>
            <line>Take your time drawing a bead</line>
            <line>I'll stand as still as you need</line>
            <line>Cause you're so good at talking smack</line>
            <line>You heart attack</line>
            <line>But you're the apple of my eye anyway</line>
            <line>My smiling face that's on my head is on a silver plate</line>
        </bridge>
        <verse>
            <line>So they say</line>
            <line>They say in heaven</line>
            <line>There's no husbands and wives</line>
            <line>On the day that I show up</line>
            <line>They'll be completely out</line>
            <line>Of their forgiveness supplies</line>
            <line>And I can't use the telephone</line>
            <line>To tell you that I'm dead and gone</line>
            <line>So you won't know</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>You won't know</line>
            <line>No, you won't know</line>
            <line>No, you won't know</line>
            <line>No, you won't know</line>
            <line>Yeah, you won't know</line>
            <line>Yeah, you won't know</line>
            <line>You won't know</line>
