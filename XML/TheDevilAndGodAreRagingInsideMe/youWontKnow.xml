<title>You Won't Know</title>

<lyrics>[Verse 1]
Hey hey hey! Mr. Hangman
Go get your rope
Your daughters weren't careful
I fear that I am a slippery slope
Now even if I lay my head down at night
After a day I got perfectly right
She won't know
She won't know

[Verse 2]
So pray, Little Kay, love is just God on a good day
And you can't blame your mother
She's trying not to see you as her worst mistake
And I wish that I could tell you right now
I love you
But it looks like I won't be around

[Chorus]
So you won't know
You won't know
You won't know
You won't know

[Verse 3]
So believe in me, believe them
You think I'll let you down?
Well I won't
They can fire everything they've got
And when you think I'm sunk
I will float on and on
I have burned the bush that covered my light
Even though I’m scared I won’t burn as bright

[Chorus]
You won't know
You won't know
You won't know
You won't know

[Bridge]
You're never going to feel as full as you felt
So let's go outside and we'll play William Tell
Take your time drawing a bead
I'll stand as still as you need
Cause you're so good at talking smack
You heart attack
But you're the apple of my eye anyway
My smiling face that's on my head is on a silver plate

[Verse 4]
So they say
They say in heaven
There's no husbands and wives
On the day that I show up
They'll be completely out
Of their forgiveness supplies
And I can't use the telephone
To tell you that I'm dead and gone
So you won't know

[Chorus Outro]
You won't know
No, you won't know
No, you won't know
No, you won't know
Yeah, you won't know
Yeah, you won't know
You won't know</lyrics>
