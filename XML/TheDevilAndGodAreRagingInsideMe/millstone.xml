<lyrics>[Verse 1]
I used to be such a burning example
I used to be so original
I used to care, I was being cared for
Made sure I showed it to those that I love
I used to sleep without a single stir
Cause I was about my father's work

[Chorus]
Well, take me out tonight (Whoa)
This ship of fools I'm on will sink
I'm my own stone around my neck
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give

[Verse 2]
I used to pray like God was listening
I used to make my parents proud
I was the glue that kept my friends together
Now they don't talk and we don't go out
I used to know the name of every person I'd kissed
Now I made this bed and I can't fall asleep in it

[Chorus]
Well, take me out tonight (Whoa)
This ship of fools I'm on will sink
I'm my own stone around my neck
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give
Throw me that lifeline
This ship of fools I'm on will sink
I'm my own stone around my neck
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give

[Bridge]
Never hit the brakes
There's no time to save him
He just ran out in the street
Anybody know his name?
I think I recognize him
Sure as hell paid for that mistake
Whoa, whoa

[Chorus]
Well, take me out tonight (Whoa)
This ship of fools I'm on will sink
I'm my own stone around my neck (Whoa)
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give
To save my life tonight (Whoa)
This ship of fools I'm on will sink
I'm my own stone around my neck (Whoa)
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give
