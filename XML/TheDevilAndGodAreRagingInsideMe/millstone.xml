    <lyrics>
        <verse>
            <line>I used to be such a burning example</line>
            <line>I used to be so original</line>
            <line>I used to care, I was being cared for</line>
            <line>Made sure I showed it to those that I love</line>
            <line>I used to sleep without a single stir</line>
            <line>Cause I was about my father's work</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>Well, take me out tonight (Whoa)</line>
            <line>This ship of fools I'm on will sink</line>
            <line>I'm my own stone around my neck</line>
            <line>Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse>
            <line>I used to pray like God was listening</line>
            <line>I used to make my parents proud</line>
            <line>I was the glue that kept my friends together</line>
            <line>Now they don't talk and we don't go out</line>
            <line>I used to know the name of every person I'd kissed</line>
            <line>Now I made this bed and I can't fall asleep in it</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>Well, take me out tonight (Whoa)</line>
            <line>This ship of fools I'm on will sink</line>
            <line>I'm my own stone around my neck</line>
            <line>Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give</line>
            <line>Throw me that lifeline</line>
            <line>This ship of fools I'm on will sink</line>
            <line>I'm my own stone around my neck</line>
            <line>Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give</line>
        </chorus>
        <bridge>
            <line>Never hit the brakes</line>
            <line>There's no time to save him</line>
            <line>He just ran out in the street</line>
            <line>Anybody know his name?</line>
            <line>I think I recognize him</line>
            <line>Sure as hell paid for that mistake</line>
            <line>Whoa, whoa</line>
        </bridge>
        <chorus>
            <line>Well, take me out tonight (Whoa)</line>
            <line>This ship of fools I'm on will sink</line>
            <line>I'm my own stone around my neck (Whoa)</line>
            <line>Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give</line>
            <line>To save my life tonight (Whoa)</line>
            <line>This ship of fools I'm on will sink</line>
            <line>I'm my own stone around my neck (Whoa)</line>
            <line>Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give</line>
