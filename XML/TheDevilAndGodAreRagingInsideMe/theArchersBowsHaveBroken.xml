<lyrics>
    [Verse 1]
    Who do you carry the torch for, my young man?
    Do you believe in anything?
    Do you carry it around just to burn things down?
    
    Meet me tonight on the turnpike, my darling
    'Cause we believe in everything
    If we sweat all these debts then we're sure to drown
    So we strap ourselves up to this engine now
    With a God who we found laying under the backseat
    
    [Chorus]
    What did you learn tonight?
    You're shouting so loud, you barely joyous, broken thing
    You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
    You are freezing over hell
    You are bringing on the end, you do so well
    You can only blame yourself, it's what I say
    
    Oh!
    
    [Verse 2]
    Order your daughters to ignore me, think that will sort me
    And sweep me under the rug
    You're beating with a book everyone
    That book tells you to love
    
    There is an ember in the heart of the kiln
    And it's burning hot with love
    Burning out my sins until there's nothing but dust
    Rollin' me with care into your cigarette
    'Cause the God I believe in never worked on a campaign trail
    
    [Chorus]
    What did you learn tonight?
    You're shouting so loud, you barely joyous, broken thing
    You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
    You are freezing over hell
    You are bringing on the end, you do so well
    You can only blame yourself, it's what I say
    
    Who do you carry the torch for, my young man?
    Do you believe in anything?
    Do you carry it around just to burn things to the ground?
    
    What did you learn tonight?
    You're shouting so loud, you barely joyous, broken thing
    You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
    You are freezing over hell
    You are bringing on the end, you do so well
    You can only blame yourself, it's what I say
    
    Feels like
    We could escape
    And I don't mind
    Throwing away
    This filthy silver tongue
    
    If you try
    Running a maze
    Of your lies
    It's too hard to save
    If you've thrown out everyone	What did
    you learn tonight?
    You're shouting so loud
    you barely joyous, broken thing
    You're a voice that never sings
    Is what I say
    You are
    freezing over hell
    
    You are bringing on the end
    you do so well
    You can only blame yourself
    It's what I say
