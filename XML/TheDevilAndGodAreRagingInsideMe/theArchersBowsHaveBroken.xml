            <line>Who do you carry the torch for, my young man?</line>
            <line>Do you believe in anything?</line>
            <line>Do you carry it around just to burn things down?</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Meet me tonight on the turnpike, my darling</line> 'Cause we believe in everything
                <line>If we sweat all these debts then we're sure to drown</line>
            <line>So we strap ourselves up to this engine now</line>
            <line>With a God who we found laying under the backseat</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>What did you learn tonight?</line>
            <line>You're shouting so loud, you barely joyous, broken thing</line>
            <line>You're a voice that never sings, is what I say</line>
            <line>You are freezing over hell</line>
            <line>You are bringing on the end, you do so well</line>
            <line>You can only blame yourself, it's what I say</line>

        <verse>
            <line>Order your daughters to ignore me, think that will sort me</line>
            <line>And sweep me under the rug</line>
            <line>You're beating with a book everyone</line>
            <line>That book tells you to love</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>There is an ember in the heart of the kiln</line>
            <line>And it's burning hot with love</line>
            <line>Burning out my sins until there's nothing but dust</line>
            <line>Rollin' me with care into your cigarette</line> 'Cause the God I believe in never
            worked on a campaign trail </verse>
