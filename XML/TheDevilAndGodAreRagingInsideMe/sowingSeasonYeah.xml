            <line>Was losing all my friends</line>
            <line>Was losing them to drinking and to driving</line>
            <line>Was losing all my friends, but I got them back</line>
            <line>I am on the mend</line>
            <line>At least now I can say that I am trying</line>
            <line>And I hope you will forget things I still lack</line>

            <line>Is it in you now</line>
            <line>To bear to hear the truth that you have spoken?</line>
            <line>Twisted up by knaves</line>
            <line>To make a trap for fools</line>
            <line>Is it in you now</line>
            <line>To watch the things you gave your life to broken?</line>
            <line>And stoop and build them up with worn out tools</line>

            <line>Nothing gets so bad</line>
            <line>A whisper from your father couldn't fix it</line>
            <line>Your whisper's like a bridge, it's a river span</line>
            <line>Take all that you have</line>
            <line>And turn it into something you would miss if</line>
            <line>Somebody threw that brick, shattered all your plans</line>

            <line>It takes a while to grow anything</line>
            <line>Before it's coming to an end, yeah</line>
            <line>Before you put my body in the cold ground</line>
            <line>Take some time to warm it with your hand</line>
            <line>Before it's coming to an end, yeah</line>

            <line>I am not your friend</line>
            <line>I am just a man who knows how to feel</line>
            <line>I am not your friend</line>
