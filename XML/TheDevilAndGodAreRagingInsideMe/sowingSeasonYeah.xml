<title>Sowing Season (Yeah)</title>
    
<lyrics>[Verse 1]
Was losing all my friends
Was losing them to drinking and to driving
Was losing all my friends, but I got them back
I am on the mend
At least now I can say that I am trying
And I hope you will forget things I still lack

[Hook]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Is it in you now
To bear to hear the truth that you have spoken?
Twisted up by knaves
To make a trap for fools
Is it in you now
To watch the things you gave your life to broken?
And stoop and build them up with worn out tools

[Hook]
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!

[Verse 3]
Nothing gets so bad
A whisper from your father couldn't fix it
Your whisper's like a bridge, it's a river span
Take all that you have
And turn it into something you would miss if
Somebody threw that brick, shattered all your plans

[Hook]
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!

[Post-Chorus]
Time to get the seeds into the cold ground
It takes a while to grow anything
Before it's coming to an end, yeah
Before you put my body in the cold ground
Take some time to warm it with your hand
Before it's coming to an end, yeah

[Bridge]
It's coming to an end, yeah
It's coming to an end, yeah

[Verse 4]
Do you miss the blend?
Colors she left in your black and white field?
Do you feel condemned just being there?
I am not your friend
I am just a man who knows how to feel
I am not your friend
I'm not your lover
I'm not your family

[Hook]
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!

[Post-Chorus]
Time to get the seeds into the cold ground
It takes a while to grow anything
Before it's coming to an end, yeah!</lyrics>
