    Sealed To Me
    <lyrics>
        You finally caught that roadrunner, and blew him up
        I finally got it through my thick cranium
        You wake up and get dressed and then you check your pressure
        Are those covalent bonds still holding you together?
        Cause I'm working hard at being my own MVP
        Instead of feeling lucky just to have made the team
        
        How you feeling?
        Are you healing?
        What's it mean to be sealed to me?
        
        If you want to finish, you could run your minute
        And make your time
        If you are without, well I'm full of it
        So come take some of mine
        
        You gonna cast me away into outer darkness
        Cause I couldn't cover rent to stay at God's apartment?
        I got a shovel and even though I've hit paydirt
        I'm really just happy to have gotten the work
        If you could be the wind then I would be a leaf
        Because I'm finished with these pliers
        Sick of pulling my teeth
        Yeah
        
        How you feeling?
        Are you healing?
        What's it mean to be sealed to me?
        
        Storm on the bay
        We all drift away
        Your kingdom never comes
        I ain't no chosen one
        
        Heart stops beating
        Float through the ceiling
        Those gates won't be sealed to me
    </lyrics>
