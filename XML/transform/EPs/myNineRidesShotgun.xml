    My Nine Rides Shotgun
    <lyrics>
        This happened before and I'm sure it'll happen again
        It's getting old, I could never know
        This is not the first time, she says its the last time again
        And you're a tease
        
        No, I'm kidding
        
        Give it some time
        Take my advice
        See these scars on me
        I'm just marking territory
        But I know a million girls who'd kill to be you right now.
        
        Give me one night inside of your theighs
        A million girls would kill to be you
        Right now
        
        And its happened before, and it'll happen again
        
        When your boyfriend comes home I should get
        Terribly close, and you'd never know
        Wouldnt be the first time
        Dont think this'll ever end
        And you're a tease
        
        No I'm kidding
        
        Give it some time
        Take my advice
        See these scars on me
        I'm just marking territory
        
        But I know a million girls who'd kill to be here right now.
        GIve me one night inside of your theighs
        A million girls would kill to be you
        Right now
        
        And this has happened before
        And it'll happen again
        
        One thing a girl I want is going to come
        It's like you're like a zombie when we're together
