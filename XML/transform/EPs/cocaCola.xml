    <lyrics>
        There's blood and feathers on my dumb paws.
        You ain't nothin' but a dead duck,
        I ain't nothin' but a hound dog.
        
        You seep in the windows and the vents,
        While I lay in the grass and I lose your scent.
        Well, if god gave me grace then why aren't I graceful?
        My joints are frozen, cold, old, and idle.
        
        If it's by air I don't wanna know.
        If we all don't take cover, we're all gonna fall back in love, again.
        
        You work late; fight off your boss.
        Your patient dies; you take the night off.
        
        They worked out all of the bugs
        So, if you have enough money, you can buy love.
        You work out your reception seating
        While I sing, sing, sing these ten lords still leaping.
        With the mark on your breast from your baby teething.
        Give him my name if he is needing.
        
        If it's by sea I don't wanna know.
        If we all don't take cover, we're all gonna fall back in love, again.
        
        "Bless your beautiful hide."
        And curse your god when your friends die.
        
        If it's by air then I don't wanna know.
        If we all don't take cover, we're all gonna fall back in love, again.
        
        You work late; fight off your boss.
        Your patient dies; you take the night off.
