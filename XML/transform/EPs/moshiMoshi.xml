    Moshi Moshi
    <lyrics>
        I think I'm crazy, baby, let you off the hook too easy
        If you were a telephone, you'd still be off the hook
        This is my last leg
        Been awake for days
        In a minute I'll die of starvation
        I'll come back a ghost if I can haunt you
        And float around your room
        
        What do I do when you get close?
        If I kissed your neck, would you slit my throat?
        
        Are you thinking of me when you're putting on your make-up, darling, and dying your hair like you do?
        Well you're wasting your time if you're trying to impress me
        I waste all my time just thinking of you
        
        And I'm not imagining how you give me the shivers
        Standing up to your waist in your river
        You're the sweetest boat-builder I think I've ever seen
        Dream in Japanese
        Dream in Japanese
        Some language I don't even know how to speak
        You're still pretty and I am still choked up
        It's probably just the same
        
        The more I hang around you
        The more hang-ups I get (more hang-ups I get)
        
        Are you thinking of me when you're putting on your makeup, darling, and dying your hair like you do?
        And dying your hair like you do
        Well you're wasting your time if you're trying to impress me
        I waste all my time just thinking of you
        
        I know that you're an angel
        Though you could never stay true
        You could never stay true
        Hey angel, I think your halo has a screw loose
        'Cause you dropped me like a brick off the rooftop of your high school
        Could I watch the next time you're applying your eyeliner?
        I waste all my time just thinking of you
