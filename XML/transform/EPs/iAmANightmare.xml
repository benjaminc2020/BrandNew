    I Am A Nightmare
    <lyrics>
        Turn tin to gold
        I want pure energy
        Throw everything I own into the fire
        I want to find a way
        I want to throw up snakes
        Do I have to die to see the other side?
        
        I am a nightmare and you are a miracle
        Coming out of the ground, it's kind of freaking me out
        I am a nightmare and you are a miracle
        I am a nightmare and you are a miracle
        Coming out of the ground, it's kind of freaking me out
        I am a nightmare and you are a miracle
        
        So come shake your Zen out
        And give me pure energy
        My heart is glowing flourescent, I want you to possess it
        I’m not a prophecy come true
        I’ve just been goddamn mean to you
        So what is this thing laced with
        Please don’t replace me
        I surrender, embrace me
        Whatever I'm faced with
        
        I am a nightmare and you are a miracle
        Coming out of the ground, it's kind of freaking me out
        I am a nightmare and you are a miracle
        I am a nightmare and you are a miracle
        Coming out of the ground, it's kind of freaking me out
        I am a nightmare and you are a miracle
        
        Blessed be the lost at sea
        The rest in peace was what they conceive in
        No, I am messed up, no distress
        I fall asleep holding your hand
        Among alien dunes, you are a pale vision of blue
        And I’m a second sail, a saved thief
        So, go save someone else
        
        I am a nightmare and you are a miracle
        Coming out of the ground, it's kind of freaking me out
        I am a nightmare and you are a miracle
        I am a nightmare and you are a miracle
        Coming out of the ground, it's kind of freaking me out
        I am a nightmare and you are a miracle
