    Out Of Range
    <lyrics>
        Hide in a stork's mouth
        Sleep 'til it's dark out
        
        All dressed up holding your receipts for the numbers that you picked
        You in a box full of your mistakes and a leaden crucifix
        
        If hearts were all made like they were balls of yarn
        Well they've all got the strings that get tugged on real hard
        Some are different lengths
        Some would be stronger than others
        And some would be the colors of your mothers and fathers
        
        Do old structures stand
        The same as any older man
        A place where something used to live
        But in the end just turns cold
        
        Am I a torn up, tattered, worn out piece of fabric
        Not suitable to stitch up a rip
        'Cause I'd like to be tightly braided
        Gold and silver bracelets
        The type you'd like to wear round your wrist
        
        As we lay
        We start to pray
        
        And in the places you go
        You'll find these people you know
        All sewing patterns into clothing that you've called your own
        And in these smaller designs
        There's something larger you might find
        That people's hands have worked together to make up the parts of you
