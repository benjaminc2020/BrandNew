    <lyrics>
        <line n="1">I'm awake, there's no part to play</line>
        <line n="2">Drinking Drano, <refer type="idiom">smoking grass</refer>, one under the pass</line>
        <line n="3">What we saw in the woods <refer img="time">today</refer>, repeat 60 cycle delay (hey)</line>
        <line n="4">My TV says it's all in your head so shake it out and share your bread</line>
        <line n="5">We're not separate, waste your thoughts and <refer type="idiom"><refer img="time">waste your time</refer></refer></line>
        <line n="6">I live in yours and you in mine</line>
        <line n="7">(Swallow the pitch that flows from the Earth)</line>

        <line n="8">Soft spot, lightning rod, my paint is peeling</line>
        <line n="9">A million suns won't fill you up</line>
        <line n="10">If you can't see the <refer img="alcohol">wine</refer> flowing over your cup</line>
        <line n="11">Last thread, dancing <refer img="death">dead</refer>, one more time with feeling</line>
        <line n="12"><refer img="rel">Pass the plate</refer> and you sit back down</line>
        <line n="13">And go back to your hole in the woods under ground</line>
        <line n="14">(Wait, wait, <refer type="idiom"><refer img="time">wait a second</refer></refer>)</line>

        <line n="15">The <refer img="time">clock ticks</refer> but you just sit and wish you had someone to wrestle
            with</line>
        <line n="16">It's a small tooth touch, it comes around and rings your bell</line>
        <line n="17">Shows you how you thought you felt</line>
        <line n="18">Slowly floss your holy molars</line>
        <line n="19"><refer img="death">Deader than a Donner daughter</refer></line>
        <line n="20">I start the <refer img="car">car</refer> with my mind</line>
        <line n="21">Fired up my fear machine, can't help what they drove into me</line>
        <line n="22">(Swallow the pitch that flows from the earth)</line>

        <line n="23">Soft spot, lightning rod, my paint is peeling</line>
        <line n="24">A million suns won't fill you up</line>
        <line n="25">If you can't see the <refer img="alcohol">wine</refer> flowing over your cup</line>
        <line n="26">Last thread, dancing dead, one more time with feeling</line>
        <line n="27"><refer img="rel">Pass the plate</refer> and you sit back down</line>
        <line n="28">And go back to your hole in the woods <refer img="earth">under ground</refer></line>

        <line n="29">Soft spot, lightning rod, my paint is peeling</line>
        <line n="30">A million suns won't fill you up</line>
        <line n="31">If you can't see the <refer img="alcohol">wine</refer> flowing over your cup</line>
        <line n="32">Last thread, dancing <refer img="death">dead</refer>, one more time with feeling</line>
        <line n="33">I pass the plate and I sit back down</line>
