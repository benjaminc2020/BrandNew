    <lyrics>
        <verse n="1">
            <line>I am heaven sent,</line>
            <line>Don't you dare forget.</line>
            <line>I am all you've ever wanted,</line>
            <line>What all the other boys all promised.</line>
            <line>Sorry I told. I just needed you to know.</line>
            <line>I think in decimals and dollars.</line>
            <line>I am the cause to all your problems,</line>
            <line>Shelter from cold. we are never alone.</line>
            <line>Coordinate brain and mouth.</line>
            <line>Then ask me whats it like to have</line>
            <line>Myself so figured out.</line>
            <line>I wish I knew..</line>
        </verse>

        <verse n="2">
            <line>I hope this song starts a craze.</line>
            <line>The kind of song that ignites the airwaves.</line>
            <line>The kind of song that makes people glad</line>
            <line>To be where they are,</line>
            <line>With whomever they're there with.</line>
            <line>This is war.</line>
            <line>Every line is about,</line>
            <line>Who I don't wanna write about anymore.</line>
            <line>Hope you come down with something</line>
            <line>They can't diagnose, don't have the cure for.</line>
            <line>Holding on to your grudge.</line>
            <line>Oh its so hard to have someone to love.</line>
            <line>And keeping quiet is hard.</line>
            <line>Cause you cant keep a secret</line>
            <line>If it never was a secret to start.</line>
            <line>At least pretend you didn't wanna get caught..</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>We're concentrating on falling apart.</line>
            <line>We were contenders, we're throwing the fight</line>
            <line>But I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe,</line>
            <line>I just wanna believe, in us.</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse n="3">
            <line>Oh, we're so c-c-c-c-c-controversial.</line>
            <line>We are entirely smooth.</line>
            <line>We admit to the truth,</line>
            <line>We are the best at what we do.</line>
            <line>And these are the words you wish you wrote down.</line>
            <line>This is the way you wish your voice sounds,</line>
            <line>Handsome and smart.</line>
            <line>Oh my tongue's the only muscle on my body</line>
            <line>That works harder than my heart.</line>
            <line>And its all from watching TV,</line>
            <line>And from speeding up my breathing.</line>
            <line>Wouldn't stop if I could.</line>
            <line>Oh it hurts to be this good.</line>
            <line>You're holding on to your grudge.</line>
            <line>Oh it hurts to always have to be honest</line>
            <line>With the one that you love.</line>
            <line>Oh, so let it go..</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>We're concentrating on falling apart.</line>
            <line>We were contenders, we're throwing the fight</line>
            <line>But I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe,</line>
            <line>I just wanna believe.</line>
            <line>We're concentrating on falling apart.</line>
            <line>We were contenders, we're throwing the fight</line>
            <line>But I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe,</line>
            <line>I just wanna believe, in us.</line>
        </chorus>

        <!--bb: Instrumental -->

        <bridge>
            <line>This is the grace that only we can bestow.</line>
            <line>This is the price you pay for loss of control.</line>
            <line>This is the break in the bend,</line>
            <line>This is the closest of calls.</line>
            <line>This is the reason you're alone,</line>
            <line>This is the rise and the fall.</line>
        </bridge>

        <chorus>
            <line>We're concentrating on falling apart.</line>
            <line>We were contenders, we're throwing the fight</line>
            <line>But I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe,</line>
            <line>I just wanna believe.</line>
            <line>We're concentrating on falling apart.</line>
            <line>We were contenders, we're throwing the fight</line>
            <line>But I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe,</line>
            <line>I just wanna believe, in us. </line>
