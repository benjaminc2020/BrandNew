    <lyrics>
        <line>We sent out the SOS call.</line>
        <line>It was a quarter past four in the morning when the storm broke our second anchor line.</line>
        <line>Four months at sea, four months of calm seas to be pounded in the shallows off the tip of Montauk Point.</line>
        <line>They call them rogues, they travel fast and alone.</line>
        <line>One-hundred-foot faces of God's good ocean gone wrong.</line>
        <line>What they call love is a risk, cause you will always get hit out of nowhere by some wave and end up on your own.</line>
        <line>The hole in the hull defied the crews attempts to bail us out.</line>
        <line>And flooded the engines and radio and half buried bow.</line>
        <line>Your tongue is a rudder.</line>
        <line>It steers the whole ship.</line>
        <line>Sends your words past your lips or keeps them safe behind your teeth.</line>
        <line>But the wrong words will strand you.</line>
        <line>Come off course while you sleep.</line>
        <line>Sweep your boat out to sea or dashed to bits on the reef.</line>
        <line>The vessel groans the ocean pressures its frame.</line>
        <line>To the port I see the lighthouse through the sleet and rain.</line>
        <line>And I wish for one more day to give my love and repay debts.</line>
        <line>But the morning finds our bodies washed up thirty miles west.</line>
        <line>They say that the captain stays fast with the ship through still and storm.</line>
        <line>But this ain't the Dakota, and the water is cold.</line>
        <line>We won't have to fight for long.</line>
        <line>This is the end.</line>
        <line>This story's old but it goes on and on until we disappear.</line>
        <line>Calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed while you were underneath.</line>
        <line>I am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains sunk below the sea.</line>
        <line>I spoke the words but never gave a thought to what they all could mean.</line>
        <line>I know that this is what you want.</line>
        <line>A funeral keeps both of us apart.</line>
        <line>You know that you are not alone.</line>
        <line>Need you like water in my lungs.</line>
        <line>This is the end.</line>
