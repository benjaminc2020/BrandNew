    <lyrics>
        <verse n="1">
            <line>Ever since I was young your word is the word that always won</line>
            <line>Worry and wake the ones you love</line>
            <line>A phone call I'd rather not receive</line>
            <line>Please use my body while I sleep</line>
            <line>My lungs are fresh and yours to keep</line>
            <line>Kept clean and they will let you breathe</line>
        </verse>

        <preChorus n="1">
            <line>Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry?</line>
            <line>I am the watch you always wear, but you forget to wind</line>
        </preChorus>

        <chorus>
            <line>Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these</line>
            <line>So I sat alone and waited out the night</line>
            <line>The best part of what has happened was the part I must have missed</line>
            <line>So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around</line>
            <line>I'm not writing my goodbyes</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse n="2">
            <line>I submit no excuse</line>
            <line>If this is what I have to do</line>
            <line>I owe you every day I wake</line>
            <line>If I could I would shrink myself</line>
            <line>And sink through your skin to your blood cells</line>
            <line>And remove whatever makes you hurt but</line>
            <line>I am too weak to be your cure</line>
        </verse>

        <preChorus n="1">
            <line>Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry?</line>
            <line>I am the watch you always wear, but you forget to wind</line>

            <line>I'm not letting you check out</line>
            <line>You will beat this, starting now</line>
            <line>And you will always be around</line>
            <line>I'm there to monitor your breathing</line>
            <line>I will watch you while you're sleeping</line>
            <line>I will keep you safe and sound</line>

        <preChorus n="2">
            <line>Does anybody remember back when you were very young?</line>
            <line>Did you ever think that you would be this blessed?</line>
        </preChorus>
