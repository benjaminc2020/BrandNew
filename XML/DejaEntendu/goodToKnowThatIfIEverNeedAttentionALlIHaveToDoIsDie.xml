    <lyrics>
        <verse n="1">
            <line>Am I correct to defend the fist that holds this pen?</line>
            <line>It's ink that lies,</line>
            <line>the pen, the page, the paper.</line>
            <line>I live, I learn.</line>
            <line>You will always take what I have earned.</line>
            <line>And so aid my end while I believe I'm winning.</line>

            <line>Our friends speak out in our defense.</line>
            <line>Pay ten deaf ears for two months rent.</line>
            <line>We burn their gallows they erect,</line>
            <line>and cut the nooses they tie for our necks.</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>You constantly make it impossible to make conversation.</line>
            <line>Keep us comatose but audible.</line>
            <line>And I like it the farther I get out.</line>
            <line>We pass it off but it's all on us.</line>
            <line>Only common conversation,</line>
            <line>it took everything I got.</line>
            <line>And I like it the farther I get out.</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse n="2">
            <line>Once said, always said.</line>
            <line>I will hold the past over your head.</line>
            <line>I'll speak my mind whenever I feel slighted.</line>
            <line>I am hellbent on extracting all of my revenge.</line>
            <line>Take heart, sweetheart, or I will take it from you.</line>


            <line>We slip concealed back to the keep.</line>
            <line>Concede to do the work for free.</line>
            <line>We prey as wolves among the sheep and slit the necks of soldiers while they
                sleep.</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>You constantly make it impossible to make conversation.</line>
            <line>Keep us comatose but audible.</line>
            <line>And I like it the farther I get out.</line>
            <line>We pass it off but it's all on us.</line>
            <line>Only common conversation,</line>
            <line>it took everything I got.</line>
            <line>And I like it the farther I get out.</line>
        </chorus>
