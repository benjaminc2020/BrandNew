<lyrics>The time has come for colds and overcoats. 
We're quiet on the ride, 
we're all just waiting to get home. 
Another week away, my greatest fear. 
I need the smell of summer, 
I need its noises in my ears. 
If looks could really kill, 
then my profession would be staring. 
Please know we do this cause we care 
and not for the thrill. 
Collect calls to home 
to tell them that I realize 
that everyone who lives will someday die 
and die alone. 

And we won't let you in. 
Though we're down and out. 
No we won't let you in.
You win, you win, you win.

I wrote more postcards than hooks. 
I read more maps than books. 
Feel like every chance to leave 
is another chance I should have took. 
Every minute is a mile. 
I've never felt so hollow. 
I'm an old abandoned church with broken pews 
and empty aisles. 
My secrets for a buck. 
Watch me as I cut myself wide open 
on this stage. Yes, I am paid 
to spill my guts. I won't see home till spring. 
Oh, I would kill for the Atlantic, 
but I am paid to make girls panic 
while I sing. 

And we won't let you in. 
Though we're down and out. 
No we won't let you in. 
And we won't let you in. 
We don't want what isn't ours. 
We won't let you in. 
You win, you win, you win.

And the coastline is quiet. 
While we're quietly losing control. 
And we're silent but sure 
we inventened the cure 
that will wash out my memories of her. 
"The harpoon is loaded. The cage is lowered. 
The water is red." 
Like you, like you.

And we won't let you in. 
Though we're down and out. 
No we won't let you in. 
And we won't let you in. 
We don't want what isn't ours. 
We won't let you in. 
You win, you win, you win.</lyrics> </root>
