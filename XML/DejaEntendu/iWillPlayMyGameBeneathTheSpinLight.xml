    <lyrics>
        <verse n="1">
            <line>The time has come for colds and overcoats. </line>
            <line>We're quiet on the ride, </line>
            <line>we're all just waiting to get home. </line>
            <line>Another week away, my greatest fear. </line>
            <line>I need the smell of summer, </line>
            <line>I need its noises in my ears. </line>
            <line>If looks could really kill, </line>
            <line>then my profession would be staring. </line>
            <line>Please know we do this cause we care </line>
            <line>and not for the thrill. </line>
            <line>Collect calls to home </line>
            <line>to tell them that I realize </line>
            <line>that everyone who lives will someday die </line>
            <line>and die alone. </line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>And we won't let you in. </line>
            <line>Though we're down and out. </line>
            <line>No we won't let you in.</line>
            <line>You win, you win, you win.</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse n="2">
            <line>I wrote more postcards than hooks. </line>
            <line>I read more maps than books. </line>
            <line>Feel like every chance to leave </line>
            <line>is another chance I should have took. </line>
            <line>Every minute is a mile. </line>
            <line>I've never felt so hollow. </line>
            <line>I'm an old abandoned church with broken pews </line>
            <line>and empty aisles. </line>
            <line>My secrets for a buck. </line>
            <line>Watch me as I cut myself wide open </line>
            <line>on this stage. Yes, I am paid </line>
            <line>to spill my guts. I won't see home till spring. </line>
            <line>Oh, I would kill for the Atlantic, </line>
            <line>but I am paid to make girls panic </line>
            <line>while I sing. </line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>And we won't let you in. </line>
            <line>Though we're down and out. </line>
            <line>No we won't let you in. </line>
            <line>And we won't let you in. </line>
            <line>We don't want what isn't ours. </line>
            <line>We won't let you in. </line>
            <line>You win, you win, you win.</line>
        </chorus>

        <bridge>
            <line>And the coastline is quiet. </line>
            <line>While we're quietly losing control. </line>
            <line>And we're silent but sure </line>
            <line>we inventened the cure </line>
            <line>that will wash out my memories of her. </line>
            <line>"The harpoon is loaded. The cage is lowered. </line>
            <line>The water is red." </line>
            <line>Like you, like you.</line>
        </bridge>

        <chorus>
            <line>And we won't let you in. </line>
            <line>Though we're down and out. </line>
            <line>No we won't let you in. </line>
            <line>And we won't let you in. </line>
            <line>We don't want what isn't ours. </line>
            <line>We won't let you in. </line>
            <line>You win, you win, you win.</line>
