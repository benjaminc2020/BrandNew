<lyrics>In a car outside, we stalk the idle kind
If you're leaving, just let me know
Tobacco and peppermint, dusting for fingerprints
A film in her eyes from the glow

Some rules are made with all intentions to break
And she defends it with a warped rationale
And I've seen what happens to the wicked and proud
When they decide to try to take on the throne for the crown

[Chorus:]
And we learn as we age
We've learned nothing and my body still aches
And you take cause they give
Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve

When it got cold outside, smoke beneath the playground lights
If you're coming home, just let me know
Sucking on your breath mint, dissected and stuck with pins
A film in her eyes from the glow

Concrete and water, she's looking for her daughter
At midnight in torrential downpour
And everything I said about how messed your head is
Was cut up and left in bits and pieces on the cutting room floor

[Chorus x2]

Take the picture from the wall when you think that nothing matters
Take the picture from the plane and it's a long ways to the floor
Cut your finger on the edge cause it's sharper than they told you
Take a leap from out the window cause it's way too far to go through the door

[Chorus]</lyrics></root>
