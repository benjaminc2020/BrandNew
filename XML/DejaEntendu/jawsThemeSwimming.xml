    <lyrics>

        <verse n="1">
            <line>In a car outside, we stalk the idle kind</line>
            <line>If you're leaving, just let me know</line>
            <line>Tobacco and peppermint, dusting for fingerprints</line>
            <line>A film in her eyes from the glow</line>

            <line>Some rules are made with all intentions to break</line>
            <line>And she defends it with a warped rationale</line>
            <line>And I've seen what happens to the wicked and proud</line>
            <line>When they decide to try to take on the throne for the crown</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>And we learn as we age</line>
            <line>We've learned nothing and my body still aches</line>
            <line>And you take cause they give</line>
            <line>Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse n="2">
            <line>When it got cold outside, smoke beneath the playground lights</line>
            <line>If you're coming home, just let me know</line>
            <line>Sucking on your breath mint, dissected and stuck with pins</line>
            <line>A film in her eyes from the glow</line>

            <line>Concrete and water, she's looking for her daughter</line>
            <line>At midnight in torrential downpour</line>
            <line>And everything I said about how messed your head is</line>
            <line>Was cut up and left in bits and pieces on the cutting room floor</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>And we learn as we age</line>
            <line>We've learned nothing and my body still aches</line>
            <line>And you take cause they give</line>
            <line>Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve</line>
        </chorus>

        <chorus>
            <line>And we learn as we age</line>
            <line>We've learned nothing and my body still aches</line>
            <line>And you take cause they give</line>
            <line>Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve</line>
        </chorus>


        <bridge>
            <line>Take the picture from the wall when you think that nothing matters</line>
            <line>Take the picture from the plane and it's a long ways to the floor</line>
            <line>Cut your finger on the edge cause it's sharper than they told you</line>
            <line>Take a leap from out the window cause it's way too far to go through the
                door</line>
        </bridge>

        <chorus>
            <line>And we learn as we age</line>
            <line>We've learned nothing and my body still aches</line>
            <line>And you take cause they give</line>
            <line>Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve</line>
        </chorus>
