    <lyrics> Keep the noise low. She doesn't wanna blow it. Shaking head to toe while your left hand
        does "the show me around." Quickens your heartbeat. It beats me straight into the ground.
        You don't recover from a night like this. A victim, still lying in bed, completely
        motionless. A hand moves in the dark to a zipper. Hear a boy bracing tight against sheets
        barely whisper, "This is so messed up." Upon arrival the guests had all stared. Dripping wet
        and clearly depressed, he'd headed straight for the stairs. No longer cool, but a boy in a
        stitch, unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships. (Up the stairs: the
        station where the act becomes the art of growing up.) He keeps his hands low. He doesn't
        wanna blow it. He's wet from head to toe and his eyes give her the up and the down. His
        stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up. But the body on the bed beckons forward and he
        starts growing up. The fever, the focus. The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too
        hard to sell. Die young and save yourself. The tickle, the taste of... It used to be the
        reason I breathed but now it's choking me up. Die young and save yourself. She hits the
        lights. This doesn't seem quite fair. Despite everything he learned from his friends, he
        doesn't feel so prepared. She's breathing quiet and smooth. He's gasping for air. "This is
        the first and last time," he says. She fakes a smile and presses her hips into his. He keeps
        his hands pinned down at his sides. He's holding back from telling her exactly what it
        really feels like. He is the lamb, she is the slaughter. She's moving way too fast and all
        he wanted was to hold her. Nothing that he tells her is really having an effect. He whispers
        that he loves her, but she's probably only looking for se-... (Up the stairs: the station
        where the act becomes the art of growing up.) So much more than he could ever give. A life
        free of lies and a meaningful relationship. He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides. He
        waits for it to end and for the aching in his guts to subside. The fever, the focus. The
        reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell. Die young and save yourself. The
        tickle, the taste of... It used to be the reason I breathed but now it's choking me up. Die
        young and save yourself. Up the stairs: the station where the act becomes the art of growing
        up. The fever, the focus. The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell.
        Die young and save yourself. The tickle, the taste of... It used to be the reason I breathed
        but now it's choking me up. Die young and save yourself.</lyrics>
