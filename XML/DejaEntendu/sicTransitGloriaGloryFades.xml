        <verse>
            <line>Keep the noise low.</line>
            <line>She doesn't wanna blow it.</line>
            <line>Shaking head to toe</line>
            <line>while your left hand does "the show me around."</line>
            <line>Quickens your heartbeat.</line>
            <line>It beats me straight into the ground.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>You don't recover from a night like this.</line>
            <line>A victim, still lying in bed, completely motionless.</line>
            <line>A hand moves in the dark to a zipper.</line>
            <line>Hear a boy bracing tight against sheets</line>
            <line>barely whisper, "This is so messed up."</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Upon arrival the guests had all stared.</line>
            <line>Dripping wet and clearly depressed,</line>
            <line>he'd headed straight for the stairs.</line>
            <line>No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch,</line>
            <line>unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships.</line>
        </verse> (Up the stairs: the station where <line>the act becomes the art of growing
            up.)</line>
        <verse>
            <line>He keeps his hands low.</line>
            <line>He doesn't wanna blow it.</line>
            <line>He's wet from head to toe and</line>
            <line>his eyes give her the up and the down.</line>
            <line>His stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up.</line>
            <line>But the body on the bed beckons forward</line>
            <line>and he starts growing up.</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>The fever, the focus.</line>
            <line>The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell.</line>
            <line>Die young and save yourself.</line>
            <line>The tickle, the taste of...</line>
            <line>It used to be the reason I breathed but now it's choking me up.</line>
            <line>Die young and save yourself.</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse>
            <line>She hits the lights.</line>
            <line>This doesn't seem quite fair.</line>
            <line>Despite everything he learned from his friends,</line>
            <line>he doesn't feel so prepared.</line>
            <line>She's breathing quiet and smooth.</line>
            <line>He's gasping for air.</line> "This is the first and last time," he says. <line>She
                fakes a smile and presses her hips into his.</line>
            <line>He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides.</line>
            <line>He's holding back from telling her</line>
            <line>exactly what it really feels like.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>He is the lamb, she is the slaughter.</line>
            <line>She's moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her.</line>
            <line>Nothing that he tells her is really having an effect.</line>
            <line>He whispers that he loves her,</line>
            <line>but she's probably only looking for se-...</line>
        </verse>
        <bridge> (Up the stairs: the station where <line>the act becomes the art of growing
                up.)</line>
        </bridge>
        <verse>
            <line>So much more than he could ever give.</line>
            <line>A life free of lies and a meaningful relationship.</line>
            <line>He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides.</line>
            <line>He waits for it to end</line>
            <line>and for the aching in his guts to subside.</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>The fever, the focus.</line>
            <line>The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell.</line>
            <line>Die young and save yourself.</line>
            <line>The tickle, the taste of...</line>
