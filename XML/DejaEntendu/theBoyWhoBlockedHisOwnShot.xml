    <lyrics>
        <verse>
            <line>If it makes you less sad, I will die by your hand</line>
            <line>Hope you find out what you are; already know what I am</line>
            <line>And if it makes you less sad, we'll start talking again</line>
            <line>You can tell me how vile I already know that I am</line>
            <line>I'll grow old, start acting my age</line>
            <line>It'll be a brand new day in a life that you hate</line>
            <line>A crown of gold, a heart that's harder than stone</line>
            <line>And it hurts a whole lot, but it's missed when it's gone</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not</line>
            <line>I'm glad that you can forgive, only hoping as time goes, you can forget</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse>
            <line>If it makes you less sad, I'll move out of this state</line>
            <line>You can keep to yourself, I'll keep out of your way</line>
            <line>And if it makes you less sad, I'll take your pictures all down</line>
            <line>Every picture you paint, I will paint myself out</line>
            <line>It's cold as a tomb, and it's dark in your room</line>
            <line>When I sneak to your bed to pour salt in your wounds</line>
            <line>So call it quits, or get a grip</line>
            <line>You say you wanted a solution; you just wanted to be missed</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not</line>
            <line>I'm glad that you can forgive, only hoping as time goes, you can forget</line>
            <line>So you can forget, you can forget</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse>
            <line>You are calm and reposed</line>
            <line>Let your beauty unfold</line>
            <line>Pale white, like the skin stretched over your bones</line>
            <line>Spring keeps you ever close</line>
            <line>You are second-hand smoke</line>
            <line>You are so fragile and thin, standing trial for your sins</line>
            <line>Holding on to yourself the best you can</line>
            <line>You are the smell before rain</line>
            <line>You are the blood in my veins</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not</line>
            <line>I'm glad that you can forgive, only hoping as time goes, you can forget</line>
