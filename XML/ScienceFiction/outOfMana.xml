    <lyrics>
        <line>First write down all of your fears</line>
        <line>Then sweep the feathers you've preened</line>
        <line>Next you should dominate</line>
        <line>All the quests everyone said were too hard</line>
        <line>Unless you go back to sleep</line>

        <line>Don't back out</line>
        <line>Or we'll back down</line>
        <line>I want you to know</line>
        <line>If you feel ready to go</line>
        <line>I can read the rest to myself</line>
        <line>Hell is digital</line>
        <line>You're smashed to smithereens</line>

        <line>We've filled out all of the forms</line>
        <line>Translated all of our dreams</line>
        <line>Freed love and perfected every inch</line>
        <line>Weeknights down at the gym</line>
        <line>Took every thing that we pleased</line>

        <line>Don't crack up</line>
        <line>Don't lose touch</line>
        <line>I want you to know</line>
        <line>If you feel ready to go</line>
        <line>I can read the rest to myself</line>
        <line>Hell is digital</line>
        <line>You'll pray to pieces</line>

        <line>I'll break and create life</line>
        <line>All praise player one</line>
        <line>Infinite lives, in time will come up</line>

        <line>Did we build Babel together</line>
        <line>Jibber jabber, changing colors</line>
        <line>Aliens talking to airplanes</line>
        <line>Every time the place is the same</line>
        <line>Hope we can do this forever</line>

        <line>Don't back out</line>
        <line>Or we'll back down</line>
        <line>I want you to know</line>
        <line>If you feel ready to go</line>
        <line>I can read the rest to myself</line>
        <line>Hell is digital</line>
        <line>You're smashed to smithereens</line>

        <line>Don't back out</line>
        <line>Or we'll back down</line>
        <line>I want you to know</line>
        <line>If you feel ready to go</line>
        <line>I can read the rest to myself</line>
        <line>Heaven's digital</line>
        <line>You burn to little bits</line>
        <line>I'm psycho</line>
        <line>Can you know this?</line>

        <line>I have to go</line>
        <line>I want to say I'm in love with you</line>
        <line>And I'm more than the skin of my teeth</line>
        <line>I digress</line>
        <line>I am a mess, I'm in love with you</line>
        <line>I will go without water or sleep</line>
        <line>I'm a ghost</line>
        <line>I can't say I know that I'm even here</line>
        <line>Or is this some eternal test</line>
        <line>Holy crow</line>
        <line>I'll never know if it's more or less</line>
        <line>No reset</line>
