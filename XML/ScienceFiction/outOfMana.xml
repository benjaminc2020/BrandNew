        Out Of Mana
    </title>
    <lyrics>
        First write down all of your fears
        Then sweep the feathers you've preened
        Next you should dominate
        All the quests everyone said were too hard
        Unless you go back to sleep
        
        Don't back out
        Or we'll back down
        I want you to know
        If you feel ready to go
        I can read the rest to myself
        Hell is digital
        You're smashed to smithereens
        
        We've filled out all of the forms
        Translated all of our dreams
        Freed love and perfected every inch
        Weeknights down at the gym
        Took every thing that we pleased
        
        Don't crack up
        Don't lose touch
        I want you to know
        If you feel ready to go
        I can read the rest to myself
        Hell is digital
        You'll pray to pieces
        
        I'll break and create life
        All praise player one
        Infinite lives, in time will come up
        
        Did we build Babel together
        Jibber jabber, changing colors
        Aliens talking to airplanes
        Every time the place is the same
        Hope we can do this forever
        
        Don't back out
        Or we'll back down
        I want you to know
        If you feel ready to go
        I can read the rest to myself
        Hell is digital
        You're smashed to smithereens
        
        Don't back out
        Or we'll back down
        I want you to know
        If you feel ready to go
        I can read the rest to myself
        Heaven's digital
        You burn to little bits
        I'm psycho
        Can you know this?
        
        I have to go
        I want to say I'm in love with you
        And I'm more than the skin of my teeth
        I digress
        I am a mess, I'm in love with you
        I will go without water or sleep
        I'm a ghost
        I can't say I know that I'm even here
        Or is this some eternal test
        Holy crow
        I'll never know if it's more or less
        No reset
