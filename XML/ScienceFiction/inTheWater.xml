    <lyrics>
        <line>In the water, they sort it out</line>
        <line>They were waist to neck in December somehow</line>
        <line>In the water, they twist and shout</line>
        <line>They were born again, so they can start living now</line>
        <line>In the water, they saw the face</line>
        <line>Of the man who once owned it, ashamed and disgraced</line>
        <line>In the water, they asked them both</line>
        <line>"How did you get the gold without digging any holes?"</line>
        <line>Never had it any other way</line>
        <line>Drowning in the praise</line>
        <line>Never had a chance to break apart</line>
        <line>Hard for them to see</line>
        <line>What's really in this place, now</line>
        <line>"Hide your daughters", the old men say</line>
        <line>You were young once before, you know how we get our way</line>
        <line>Feel the horror with no delay</line>
        <line>We all see what once was beautiful has turned and old and grey</line>
        <line>Never had it any other way</line>
        <line>Drowning in the praise</line>
        <line>Never had a chance to break apart</line>
        <line>Hard for them to see</line>
        <line>It's really a disgrace</line>
        <line>I can't think it enough</line>
        <line>Can't say it enough</line>
        <line>Can't do it enough</line>
        <line>I can't make it enough</line>
        <line>Can't fake it enough</line>
        <line>I don't want it enough</line>
        <line>So everyone'll wait</line>
        <line>Never had it any other way</line>
        <line>Drowning in the grace</line>
        <line>Never had a chance to break apart</line>
        <line>Hard for them to see</line>
        <line>It's really in its place</line>
        <line>I can't say it enough</line>
        <line>Can't sing it enough</line>
        <line>So I'll find another way</line>
        <line>And we sing this morning that wonderful and grand ol' message</line>
        <line>And I don't know about you, I never get tired of it</line>
        <line>Numbe-</line>
        <line>The seven years</line>
        <line>The seven years</line>
        <line>The seven years</line>
        <line>The seven years</line>
        <line>The seven years</line>
        <line>The seven years</line>
        <line>The seven years</line>
