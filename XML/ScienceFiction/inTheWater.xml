    <lyrics>
        In the water, they sort it out
        They were waist to neck in December somehow
        In the water, they twist and shout
        They were born again, so they can start living now
        In the water, they saw the face
        Of the man who once owned it, ashamed and disgraced
        In the water, they asked them both
        "How did you get the gold without digging any holes?"
        
        Never had it any other way
        Drowning in the praise
        Never had a chance to break apart
        Hard for them to see
        What's really in this place, now
        
        "Hide your daughters", the old men say
        You were young once before, you know how we get our way
        Feel the horror with no delay
        We all see what once was beautiful has turned and old and grey
        
        Never had it any other way
        Drowning in the praise
        Never had a chance to break apart
        Hard for them to see
        It's really a disgrace
        
        I can't think it enough
        Can't say it enough
        Can't do it enough
        I can't make it enough
        Can't fake it enough
        I don't want it enough
        So everyone'll wait
        
        Never had it any other way
        Drowning in the grace
        Never had a chance to break apart
        Hard for them to see
        It's really in its place
        
        I can't say it enough
        Can't sing it enough
        So I'll find another way
        
        And we sing this morning that wonderful and grand ol' message
        And I don't know about you, I never get tired of it
        Numbe-
        
        The seven years
        The seven years
        The seven years
        The seven years
        The seven years
        The seven years
        The seven years
