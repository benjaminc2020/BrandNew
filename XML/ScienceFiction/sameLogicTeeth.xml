    <lyrics>
        It's hard to walk through all the places that your life used to be in
        So you thought you'd shed a layer, maybe try on some new skin
        Your friends are all imaginary, your shrink stopped answering her phone
        So you decide to make incisions at your home while you're alone, all alone
        
        But you're no tailor, you're no surgeon, none of your cuts go very straight
        Every new layer you uncover reveals something else you hate
        And then you cracked your head, and broke some bones
        And when you glued them back together you found out you did it wrong
        
        Well this is the same logic that got us into trouble the first time
        (When we discovered we could use)
        The same logic to get us out of trouble
        And shake off all the people we abuse
        
        I don't need to know where you come from
        If you don't know where you belong
        So how's it feel to walk around, like you're some sort of freak
        You're just a monster in a costume
        A shade of what you used to be
        
        And you've got your kind of brand new face on, where all the skin's pulled thin and taut
        And every kid you see starts crying so you stop going out for walks
        Well I guess nothing can be perfect, so here's a comforting thought
        At the bottom of the ocean fish won't judge you by your faults
        (Judge you by your faults)
        
        Well this is the same logic that got us into trouble the first time
        (When we discovered we could use)
        The same logic to get us out of trouble
        And shake off all the people we abuse
        
        Don't need to know where you come from
        If you don't know where you belong
        So how's it feel to walk around, like you're some sort of freak
        You're just an actor, but now they caught you
        A shade of what you used to be
        
        Goddamnit you look so lovely, but you sound, you sound, you sound so ugly
        Goddamnit you look so lovely, but you sound, you sound, you sound so ugly
        Well Goddamnit, you look so lovely, but you sound, you sound, you sound so ugly
        Well Goddamnit, you look so lovely, but you sound, you sound, you sound so ugly
        
        Boy, we gave you every opportunity
        Boy we gave our hands to get you off your knees
        Boy sat at our table and ate everything
        You say that you're still hungry
        Then bite the plates and break your teeth
        
        We started with psychodrama...
