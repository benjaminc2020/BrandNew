    <lyrics>
        <line>It's hard to walk through all the places that your life used to be in</line>
        <line>So you thought you'd shed a layer, maybe try on some new skin</line>
        <line>Your friends are all imaginary, your shrink stopped answering her phone</line>
        <line>So you decide to make incisions at your home while you're alone, all alone</line>

        <line>But you're no tailor, you're no surgeon, none of your cuts go very straight</line>
        <line>Every new layer you uncover reveals something else you hate</line>
        <line>And then you cracked your head, and broke some bones</line>
        <line>And when you glued them back together you found out you did it wrong</line>

        <line>Well this is the same logic that got us into trouble the first time</line>
        <line>(When we discovered we could use)</line>
        <line>The same logic to get us out of trouble</line>
        <line>And shake off all the people we abuse</line>

        <line>I don't need to know where you come from</line>
        <line>If you don't know where you belong</line>
        <line>So how's it feel to walk around, like you're some sort of freak</line>
        <line>You're just a monster in a costume</line>
        <line>A shade of what you used to be</line>

        <line>And you've got your kind of brand new face on, where all the skin's pulled thin and
            taut</line>
        <line>And every kid you see starts crying so you stop going out for walks</line>
        <line>Well I guess nothing can be perfect, so here's a comforting thought</line>
        <line>At the bottom of the ocean fish won't judge you by your faults</line>
        <line>(Judge you by your faults)</line>

        <line>Well this is the same logic that got us into trouble the first time</line>
        <line>(When we discovered we could use)</line>
        <line>The same logic to get us out of trouble</line>
        <line>And shake off all the people we abuse</line>

        <line>Don't need to know where you come from</line>
        <line>If you don't know where you belong</line>
        <line>So how's it feel to walk around, like you're some sort of freak</line>
        <line>You're just an actor, but now they caught you</line>
        <line>A shade of what you used to be</line>

        <line>Goddamnit you look so lovely, but you sound, you sound, you sound so ugly</line>
        <line>Goddamnit you look so lovely, but you sound, you sound, you sound so ugly</line>
        <line>Well Goddamnit, you look so lovely, but you sound, you sound, you sound so ugly</line>
        <line>Well Goddamnit, you look so lovely, but you sound, you sound, you sound so ugly</line>

        <line>Boy, we gave you every opportunity</line>
        <line>Boy we gave our hands to get you off your knees</line>
        <line>Boy sat at our table and ate everything</line>
        <line>You say that you're still hungry</line>
        <line>Then bite the plates and break your teeth</line>

        <line>We started with psychodrama...</line>
