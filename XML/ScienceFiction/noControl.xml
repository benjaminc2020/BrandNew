    <lyrics>
        In the end, we weren't much
        With the hollow space
        Shrank down inside of all of us
        For the good
        Of all men
        Hold me down
        Underwater and don't let me up again
        
        No control
        No control
        No control
        No control
        
        Be for someone else
        Love is in your actions (yeah!)
        I got a job
        So let me find 10 million distractions
        Some get sick
        Some don't get cured
        That's how it goes
        But the worst is over
        Chum and throw me overboard
        
        No control (I thought I knew the way out but then)
        No control (It started over again)
        No control (I hear your voice coming through the grey)
        No control ("Run away")
        
        Holding the mic to this pillar of salt
        She won't sing anything at all
        Kiss me once on each eyelid
        So I can see how I dreamed it
        
        No control
        No control
        No control
        No control
        No control (I thought I knew the way out but then)
        No control (It started over again)
        No control (I hear your voice coming through the grey)
        No control ("Run away")
        
        Evil laugh
