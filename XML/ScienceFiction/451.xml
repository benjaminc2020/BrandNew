    <lyrics>
        <line>I'm awake, there's no part to play</line>
        <line>Drinking Drano, smoking grass, one under the pass</line>
        <line>What we saw in the woods today, repeat 60 cycle delay (hey)</line>
        <line>My TV says it's all in your head so shake it out and share your bread</line>
        <line>We're not separate, waste your thoughts and waste your time</line>
        <line>I live in yours and you in mine</line>
        <line>(Swallow the pitch that flows from the Earth)</line>
        
        <line>Soft spot, lightning rod, my paint is peeling</line>
        <line>A million suns won't fill you up</line>
        <line>If you can't see the wine flowing over your cup</line>
        <line>Last thread, dancing dead, one more time with feeling</line>
        <line>Pass the plate and you sit back down</line>
        <line>And go back to your hole in the woods under ground</line>
        <line>(Wait, wait, wait a second)</line>
        
        <line>The clock ticks but you just sit and wish you had someone to wrestle with</line>
        <line>It's a small tooth touch, it comes around and rings your bell</line>
        <line>Shows you how you thought you felt</line>
        <line>Slowly floss your holy molars</line>
        <line>Deader than a Donner daughter</line>
        <line>I start the car with my mind</line>
        <line>Fired up my fear machine, can't help what they drove into me</line>
        <line>(Swallow the pitch that flows from the earth)</line>
        
        <line>Soft spot, lightning rod, my paint is peeling</line>
        <line>A million suns won't fill you up</line>
        <line>If you can't see the wine flowing over your cup</line>
        <line>Last thread, dancing dead, one more time with feeling</line>
        <line>Pass the plate and you sit back down</line>
        <line>And go back to your hole in the woods under ground</line>
        
        <line>Soft spot, lightning rod, my paint is peeling</line>
        <line>A million suns won't fill you up</line>
        <line>If you can't see the wine flowing over your cup</line>
        <line>Last thread, dancing dead, one more time with feeling</line>
        <line>I pass the plate and I sit back down</line>
        <line>And go back to my hole in the woods under ground</line>
