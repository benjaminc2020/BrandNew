    <lyrics>
        I'm awake, there's no part to play
        Drinking Drano, smoking grass, one under the pass
        What we saw in the woods today, repeat 60 cycle delay (hey)
        My TV says it's all in your head so shake it out and share your bread
        We're not separate, waste your thoughts and waste your time
        I live in yours and you in mine
        (Swallow the pitch that flows from the Earth)
        
        Soft spot, lightning rod, my paint is peeling
        A million suns won't fill you up
        If you can't see the wine flowing over your cup
        Last thread, dancing dead, one more time with feeling
        Pass the plate and you sit back down
        And go back to your hole in the woods under ground
        (Wait, wait, wait a second)
        
        The clock ticks but you just sit and wish you had someone to wrestle with
        It's a small tooth touch, it comes around and rings your bell
        Shows you how you thought you felt
        Slowly floss your holy molars
        Deader than a Donner daughter
        I start the car with my mind
        Fired up my fear machine, can't help what they drove into me
        (Swallow the pitch that flows from the earth)
        
        Soft spot, lightning rod, my paint is peeling
        A million suns won't fill you up
        If you can't see the wine flowing over your cup
        Last thread, dancing dead, one more time with feeling
        Pass the plate and you sit back down
        And go back to your hole in the woods under ground
        
        Soft spot, lightning rod, my paint is peeling
        A million suns won't fill you up
        If you can't see the wine flowing over your cup
        Last thread, dancing dead, one more time with feeling
        I pass the plate and I sit back down
        And go back to my hole in the woods under ground
