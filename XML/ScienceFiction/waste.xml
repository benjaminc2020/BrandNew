    <lyrics>
        <line>Scream in there.</line>
        <line>AHHHHHH!</line>
        <line>You and I are stuck in our ways</line>
        <line>Talking about our salad days</line>
        <line>What a damn lie</line>
        <line>But you and I are stuck like glue</line>
        <line>And that's the God damn truth</line>
        <line>Baby, bye-bye</line>
        <line>Well, you could turn to water and we'd all float on</line>
        <line>Give up trying to be someone</line>
        <line>Take your head apart</line>
        <line>Free your own heart</line>
        <line>You and I are stuck out of phase</line>
        <line>Always begging for some grace when there's no time</line>
        <line>We get no reply</line>
        <line>Every night you were tripping out</line>
        <line>In the morning you were coming down</line>
        <line>If it's breaking your heart, if nothing is fun</line>
        <line>Don't lose hope, my son</line>
        <line>This is the last one</line>
        <line>You and I repent of our sins</line>
        <line>Yeah, we feel so American laying in the road</line>
        <line>Was a shoe-in for the crash of the day</line>
        <line>And we're never going to walk away</line>
        <line>Never going home</line>
        <line>I'm hoping that in time, you can lay down</line>
        <line>All this weight you've been carrying around and maybe one day</line>
        <line>You'll find your way</line>
        <line>To climb on up out of your grave</line>
        <line>With the bits of you you managed to save</line>
        <line>And for the last time</line>
        <line>Yeah, you say good-bye</line>
        <line>Every night you were tripping out</line>
        <line>In the morning you were coming down</line>
        <line>If it's breaking your heart, if nothing is fun</line>
        <line>Don't lose hope, my son</line>
        <line>This is the last one</line>
        <line>'Cause every night had you laid low</line>
        <line>It's going to feel so good to let it go</line>
        <line>It's all in your head, your race is run</line>
        <line>Don't give up, my son, this is the last one</line>
        <line>This is the last one</line>
        <line>You are not alone, you are not alone</line>
        <line>You are not alone, you get to reset</line>
        <line>You are not alone, you are not alone</line>
        <line>You are not alone, you get to reset</line>
        <line>Every night you were tripping out</line>
        <line>In the morning you were coming down</line>
        <line>If it's breaking your heart, if nothing is fun</line>
        <line>Don't lose hope, my son</line>
        <line>This is the last one</line>
        <line>Every night had you laid low</line>
        <line>It's going to feel so good to let it go</line>
        <line>It's all in your head, your race is run</line>
        <line>Don't give up, my son, this is the last one</line>
        <line>This is the last one</line>
