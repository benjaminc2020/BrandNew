    <lyrics>
        Scream in there.
        
        AHHHHHH!
        
        You and I are stuck in our ways
        Talking about our salad days
        What a damn lie
        
        But you and I are stuck like glue
        And that's the God damn truth
        Baby, bye-bye
        
        Well, you could turn to water and we'd all float on
        Give up trying to be someone
        Take your head apart
        Free your own heart
        You and I are stuck out of phase
        Always begging for some grace when there's no time
        We get no reply
        
        Every night you were tripping out
        In the morning you were coming down
        If it's breaking your heart, if nothing is fun
        Don't lose hope, my son
        This is the last one
        
        You and I repent of our sins
        Yeah, we feel so American laying in the road
        Was a shoe-in for the crash of the day
        And we're never going to walk away
        Never going home
        
        I'm hoping that in time, you can lay down
        All this weight you've been carrying around and maybe one day
        You'll find your way
        To climb on up out of your grave
        With the bits of you you managed to save
        And for the last time
        Yeah, you say good-bye
        
        Every night you were tripping out
        In the morning you were coming down
        If it's breaking your heart, if nothing is fun
        Don't lose hope, my son
        This is the last one
        
        'Cause every night had you laid low
        It's going to feel so good to let it go
        It's all in your head, your race is run
        Don't give up, my son, this is the last one
        This is the last one
        
        You are not alone, you are not alone
        You are not alone, you get to reset
        You are not alone, you are not alone
        You are not alone, you get to reset
        
        Every night you were tripping out
        In the morning you were coming down
        If it's breaking your heart, if nothing is fun
        Don't lose hope, my son
        This is the last one
        
        Every night had you laid low
        It's going to feel so good to let it go
        It's all in your head, your race is run
        Don't give up, my son, this is the last one
        This is the last one
