    <lyrics>
        <line>Do you know the words that make the hidden door open?</line>
        <line>Can you speak my secret name and fix me?</line>
        <line>I have no heart, I have no brain</line>
        <line>Lord I have no courage</line>
        <line>Can you get me home again?</line>
        <line>Could never be heaven without you</line>
        <line>Could never be heaven without you</line>
        <line>Never be heaven without you</line>
        <line>I was drowning in the lake, damned</line>
        <line>Over a dead mining town</line>
        <line>The cars and the homes lay still in the water</line>
        <line>The deeper I sank, the less I died</line>
        <line>The trees swayed, slow in the tide</line>
        <line>There were people I love below me singing</line>
        <line>And all of the songs were about you</line>
        <line>And all of the songs were about you</line>
        <line>And all of the songs were about you</line>
        <line>The whale is well-rehearsed</line>
        <line>Swimming circles in the church</line>
        <line>A Cardinalfish says, "God is dead"</line>
        <line>The whale says, "Get out of my head</line>
        <line>Get out of my head</line>
        <line>Get out of my head"</line>
        <line>You are not alone</line>
        <line>We are not separate</line>
        <line>My daughter's shoulders are my shoulders</line>
        <line>My son's hands my hands</line>
        <line>My wife's heart my own heart</line>
        <line>I've heard the outer darkness is really nice this time of year</line>
        <line>Could never be heaven without you</line>
        <line>Never be heaven without you</line>
        <line>Never be heaven without</line>
        <line>Could never be heaven without you</line>
        <line>Never be heaven without you</line>
        <line>Never be heaven without you</line>
        <line>"You've got so many things that you do believe you've been conditioned to believe
            in..."</line>
        <line> </line>
        <line>"Mmhmm."</line>
        <line> </line>
        <line>"And then if you try and break away from your conditioning and try and be sort of
            individual and, in least in our day and age right now, you start to think, 'Well, am I
            really doing this because I really want to be different? Am I doing it because there's
            such an emphasis placed to...'"</line>
        <line>"I miss you."</line>
        <line>"You don't know how to break through this contradictory mess... and really find your
            own... authentic individuality."</line>
