        Could Never Be Heaven    
    </title>
    <lyrics>
        Do you know the words that make the hidden door open?
        Can you speak my secret name and fix me?
        I have no heart, I have no brain
        Lord I have no courage
        Can you get me home again?
        
        Could never be heaven without you
        Could never be heaven without you
        Never be heaven without you
        
        I was drowning in the lake, damned
        Over a dead mining town
        The cars and the homes lay still in the water
        The deeper I sank, the less I died
        The trees swayed, slow in the tide
        There were people I love below me singing
        
        And all of the songs were about you
        And all of the songs were about you
        And all of the songs were about you
        
        The whale is well-rehearsed
        Swimming circles in the church
        A Cardinalfish says, "God is dead"
        The whale says, "Get out of my head
        Get out of my head
        Get out of my head"
        
        You are not alone
        We are not separate
        My daughter's shoulders are my shoulders
        My son's hands my hands
        My wife's heart my own heart
        I've heard the outer darkness is really nice this time of year
        
        Could never be heaven without you
        Never be heaven without you
        Never be heaven without
        Could never be heaven without you
        Never be heaven without you
        Never be heaven without you
        
        "You've got so many things that you do believe you've been conditioned to believe in..."
        
        "Mmhmm."
        
        "And then if you try and break away from your conditioning and try and be sort of individual and, in least in our day and age right now, you start to think, 'Well, am I really doing this because I really want to be different? Am I doing it because there's such an emphasis placed to...'"
        
        "I miss you."
        
        "You don't know how to break through this contradictory mess... and really find your own... authentic individuality."
