    <lyrics>
        <line>In the valley of your slowly-fading memory</line>
        <line>Are there pastures bathed in some uncertain light where you wonâ€™t graze?</line>
        <line>Paths you won't take?</line>
        
        <line>Spin around now</line>
        <line>Can you hear me?</line>
        <line>Am I still buzzing in my sleep?</line>
        <line>What does it feel like to shine between everything?</line>
        
        <line>It's never going to stop</line>
        <line>Batter up</line>
        <line>Give me your best shot</line>
        <line>Batter up</line>
        
        <line>I saw something in the night sky over Camden</line>
        <line>Turned around and drove the opposite direction 'cause I fear them</line>
        <line>Now when will they come?</line>
        
        <line>You were all I see</line>
        <line>You were everything</line>
        <line>Cast about you, turning up your gravity and pull me in</line>
        <line>Or under</line>
        
        <line>It's never going to stop</line>
        <line>Batter up</line>
        <line>Give me your best shot</line>
        <line>Batter up</line>
        
        <line>And even though the roar died in your throat</line>
        <line>The lines get blurred</line>
        <line>Lose whoever you once were</line>
        <line>Died and returned to the earth</line>
        <line>Found ourselves back</line>
        <line>In love</line>
        
        <line>It's never going to stop</line>
        <line>Batter up</line>
        <line>Give me your best shot</line>
        <line>Batter up</line>
        <line>Never gets forgot</line>
        <line>Batter up</line>
        <line>Don't get what you want</line>
        <line>Batter up</line>
        <line>Batter up</line>
        <line>Batter up</line>
        
        <line>That was the one right there...This is what we were waiting for...</line>
