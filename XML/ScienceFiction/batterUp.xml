    <lyrics>
        In the valley of your slowly-fading memory
        Are there pastures bathed in some uncertain light where you wonâ€™t graze?
        Paths you won't take?
        
        Spin around now
        Can you hear me?
        Am I still buzzing in my sleep?
        What does it feel like to shine between everything?
        
        It's never going to stop
        Batter up
        Give me your best shot
        Batter up
        
        I saw something in the night sky over Camden
        Turned around and drove the opposite direction 'cause I fear them
        Now when will they come?
        
        You were all I see
        You were everything
        Cast about you, turning up your gravity and pull me in
        Or under
        
        It's never going to stop
        Batter up
        Give me your best shot
        Batter up
        
        And even though the roar died in your throat
        The lines get blurred
        Lose whoever you once were
        Died and returned to the earth
        Found ourselves back
        In love
        
        It's never going to stop
        Batter up
        Give me your best shot
        Batter up
        Never gets forgot
        Batter up
        Don't get what you want
        Batter up
        Batter up
        Batter up
        
        That was the one right there...This is what we were waiting for...
