        Can't Get It Out    
    </title>
    <lyrics>
        As we glide over whatever
        We know to be over forever
        I really hope the shame is less
        For what we feel in times of stress
        
        But, I guess that's just depression
        No sense in fighting it now
        You had me caught in your headlights
        You were running me down
        
        We speak in tongues and start to teethe
        Lift your voice and scrape your knees
        Kids in love will plant a seed
        Resurrect and start to breathe
        
        I thought I was a creator
        I'm here just hanging around
        Got my messiah impression
        I think I got it nailed down
        
        I want to tell you we're alright
        Want to erase all your doubt
        I've got this thorn dug in deeply
        Sometimes I can't get it out
        Sometimes I can't get it out
        Sometimes I can't get it out
        Sometimes I can't get it out
        
        I'm strumming with a heavy wrist
        Were you one of the cured kids?
        My shins burn for the replica youth
        I hope that we can eject soon
        
        Because I don't want to surrender
        Or lose your face in the crowd
        I finally found all my courage
        It was buried under the house
        
        Not just a manic depressive
        Toting around my own cloud
        I've got a positive message
        Sometimes I can't get it out
        Sometimes I can't get it out
        Sometimes I can't get it out
        Sometimes I can't get it out
