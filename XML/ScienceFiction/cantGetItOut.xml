    <lyrics>
        <line>As we glide over whatever</line>
        <line>We know to be over forever</line>
        <line>I really hope the shame is less</line>
        <line>For what we feel in times of stress</line>

        <line>But, I guess that's just depression</line>
        <line>No sense in fighting it now</line>
        <line>You had me caught in your headlights</line>
        <line>You were running me down</line>

        <line>We speak in tongues and start to teethe</line>
        <line>Lift your voice and scrape your knees</line>
        <line>Kids in love will plant a seed</line>
        <line>Resurrect and start to breathe</line>

        <line>I thought I was a creator</line>
        <line>I'm here just hanging around</line>
        <line>Got my messiah impression</line>
        <line>I think I got it nailed down</line>

        <line>I want to tell you we're alright</line>
        <line>Want to erase all your doubt</line>
        <line>I've got this thorn dug in deeply</line>
        <line>Sometimes I can't get it out</line>
        <line>Sometimes I can't get it out</line>
        <line>Sometimes I can't get it out</line>
        <line>Sometimes I can't get it out</line>

        <line>I'm strumming with a heavy wrist</line>
        <line>Were you one of the cured kids?</line>
        <line>My shins burn for the replica youth</line>
        <line>I hope that we can eject soon</line>

        <line>Because I don't want to surrender</line>
        <line>Or lose your face in the crowd</line>
        <line>I finally found all my courage</line>
        <line>It was buried under the house</line>

        <line>Not just a manic depressive</line>
        <line>Toting around my own cloud</line>
        <line>I've got a positive message</line>
        <line>Sometimes I can't get it out</line>
        <line>Sometimes I can't get it out</line>
        <line>Sometimes I can't get it out</line>
        <line>Sometimes I can't get it out</line>
