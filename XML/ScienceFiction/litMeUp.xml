        Lit Me Up

    <lyrics>
        This tape recounts a dream which occurred close to the termination of approximately 400 hours of intensive, individual therapy. Now, the patient recounts her dream:
        
        I had this dream earlier this morning and I wrote it down. The dream is that I'm in some sort of a... and I'm in a hotel I'm at... I'm like at a convention or something. And I feel sort of almost like there's too much going on. There are all different kinds of meetings going on. Stuff on experimental psych and therapy, chemical aspects. All of it
        
        But, I'm... while I don't mind having all this going on inside of me. It's sort of... I think I'm going to be relieved when it's over. When I can sort of settle back down
        
        It's where you live, but you don't know how it's built
        If we're just dust, then it doesn't matter who you kill
        Don't cut me up and tell me that it's ok
        Just turn it off 'cause I don't care anyway
        
        It lit me up
        It lit me up
        It lit me up
        It lit me up
        
        Something's stirring in a deep Atlantic trench
        Doesn't forget the thousand years before it slept
        It's the beast, it's my heart, it's open
        Dive down into its unit in its head
        
        It lit me up
        It lit me up
        It lit me up
        It lit me up
        
        It lit me up like a torch on a pitch black night
        Like an ember in the needles of a dried out pine
        Lit me up and I burn from the inside out
        Yeah, I burn like a witch in a Puritan town
        It lit me
        It lit me
        
        When I grow up I want to be a heretic
        I want to climb over the wall 'cause I'm not on the list
        I want to put my hands to work till the work's done
        I want to open up my heart like the ocean
        
        It lit me up
        It lit me up
        It lit me up
        It lit me up
        
        It lit me up like a rag soaked in gasoline
        In the neck of the bottle breaking right at my feet
        It lit me up and I burned from the inside out
        Yeah, I burned like a witch in a Puritan town
        It lit me
        It was a good dream
        
        If so...you will be dead tonight
