        Under the ocean
        Next to a boiling vent
        He's none the wiser
        Earth's only resident
        It piled up
        Man, it was wall to wall
        Blink of an eye
        And all the problems solved
        
        Let's all go play Nagasaki
        We can all get vaporised
        Hold my hand, let's turn to ash
        I'll see you on the other side
        
        Hey it’s D1
        I don’t know why it’s been so crazy... I haven’t gotten any letters from you in the last 2 days... I guess the mail kind of screwed up too...when the both of us get here it always is... If there wasn’t a war going on this place would be pretty nice
        
        Before the garden
        When you were all alone
        You made the atom
        Was that some inside joke
        Open the gates
        And then conceal the path
        Let's load the gun
        And see how long they last
        
        “There goes the siren again
        Oh, there, goes another round I gotta- uh, go to a bunker now"
        
        Let's go ring and run the bunkers
        Baby won't you come outside?
        Across the sea the birds are free
        Let's watch them scream across the sky
        Let's all go and meet our maker
        They don't care whose side you're on
        We're so afraid, I prayed and prayed
        Before I learned to love the bomb
        
        They won’t send you over to the side you’re not—He’s… he’s brave and he’s always going to that bunker, so don’t worry about him... No I’m not, there’s just not much more to say... Give my love to your parents and to my parents... I’ll send them a few things as soon as I get to where I’m going to—Soon I’ll be back home with my love, soon...I’ll be...But yeah... P.S. Duke, I love you
        
        Let's all go play Nagasaki
        What a lovely way to die
        A final show and we all go
        So no one has to say goodbye
        Let's all go and meet our maker
        Won't matter whose side you're on
        We're so afraid, I prayed and prayed
        When God told me to love the bomb
