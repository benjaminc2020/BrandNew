    <lyrics>
        <line>Last night I heard a voice that said, "This is the end"</line>
        <line>All my nerves have been worn to the threads</line>
        <line>I only honestly have one or two left</line>
        <line>I got my faith, I got my family</line>
        <line>I got a wire fence around my whole stake</line>
        <line>If I believe only half what I read</line>
        <line>I got a reason to be dug in deep</line>

        <line>It's revelation saying</line>
        <line>Don't come running to me</line>
        <line>When they're coming for you</line>

        <line>I seen those boys kissing boys</line>
        <line>With their mouth in the street</line>
        <line>But I raised my son to be a righteous man</line>
        <line>I made it clear to him what fear of God means</line>

        <line>I'd hold him down under Tompkins Lake</line>
        <line>Before I ever let him go to the wolves</line>
        <line>The path we walk is only narrow and straight</line>
        <line>No son of mine will wander astray</line>
        <line>Abomination</line>

        <line>Don't come running to me when they're coming for you</line>
        <line>(Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)</line>
        <line>Don't come running to me when they're coming for you</line>
        <line>(Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)</line>

        <line>Last night I heard a voice that said, “Don't give up your gun”</line>
        <line>They keep washing right up on those shores</line>
        <line>Man they're gathering their numbers up</line>
        <line>Those bleeding hearts come marching down my road</line>
        <line>Well I'll be waiting right here at my door</line>
        <line>It's a lie to say it wouldn't be fun</line>
        <line>If you're joining them then I got one</line>
        <line>With your name on it</line>

        <line>Don't come running to me when they're coming for you</line>
        <line>(Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)</line>
        <line>Don't come running to me when they're coming for you</line>
        <line>(Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)</line>

        <line>Don't come running to me when they come gunning for you</line>
        <line>(Don't come running to me when they come gunning for you)</line>

        <line>Don't come running to me when they're coming for you</line>
        <line>(Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)</line>

        <line>God is love</line>
