    <lyrics>
        Last night I heard a voice that said, "This is the end"
        All my nerves have been worn to the threads
        I only honestly have one or two left
        I got my faith, I got my family
        I got a wire fence around my whole stake
        If I believe only half what I read
        I got a reason to be dug in deep
        
        It's revelation saying
        Don't come running to me
        When they're coming for you
        
        I seen those boys kissing boys
        With their mouth in the street
        But I raised my son to be a righteous man
        I made it clear to him what fear of God means
        
        I'd hold him down under Tompkins Lake
        Before I ever let him go to the wolves
        The path we walk is only narrow and straight
        No son of mine will wander astray
        Abomination
        
        Don't come running to me when they're coming for you
        (Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)
        Don't come running to me when they're coming for you
        (Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)
        
        Last night I heard a voice that said, “Don't give up your gun”
        They keep washing right up on those shores
        Man they're gathering their numbers up
        Those bleeding hearts come marching down my road
        Well I'll be waiting right here at my door
        It's a lie to say it wouldn't be fun
        If you're joining them then I got one
        With your name on it
        
        Don't come running to me when they're coming for you
        (Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)
        Don't come running to me when they're coming for you
        (Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)
        
        Don't come running to me when they come gunning for you
        (Don't come running to me when they come gunning for you)
        
        Don't come running to me when they're coming for you
        (Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)
        
        God is love
