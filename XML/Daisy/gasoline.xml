    <lyrics>
        <verse n="1">
            <line>So you tried to put a fire out</line>
            <line>But you used gasoline</line>
            <line>And when the congregation gathered round</line>
            <line>You're screaming "it wasn't me"</line>
            <line>So there's a sickness that is going round</line>
            <line>But no one's got a vaccine</line>
            <line>I think it drowned in holy water</line>
            <line>I think it's time we all come clean</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>I swear it's like dying</line>
            <line>To catch a ghost</line>
            <line>It feels like I'm trying</line>
            <line>To hold smoke</line>
            <line>I swear it's like dying</line>
            <line>To catch a ghost</line>
            <line>It feels like I'm trying</line>
            <line>To hold smoke</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse n="2">
            <line>When the army had to hold the line</line>
            <line>Well you were nowhere near the front</line>
            <line>Before the kids could tell the dog "goodbye",</line>
            <line>Well you were loading up your gun</line>
            <line>I wanna know I've left the great divide</line>
            <line>I wanna know what I've become</line>
            <line>You think that no one else is lonesome</line>
            <line>You think that you're the only one</line>
        </verse>

        <bridge>
            <line>It feels like I'm jumping towards a train</line>
            <line>It feels like I'm jumping towards a train</line>
            <line>Well I'm trying to find a way</line>

            <line>It feels like I'm jumping towards a train</line>
            <line>It feels like I'm jumping towards a train</line>
            <line>Well I'm trying to find a way</line>
        </bridge>
