    <title>Gasoline</title>
    <lyrics>
        So you tried to put a fire out
        But you used gasoline
        And when the congregation gathered round
        You're screaming "it wasn't me"
        So there's a sickness that is going round
        But no one's got a vaccine
        I think it drowned in holy water
        I think it's time we all come clean
        
        I swear it's like dying
        To catch a ghost
        It feels like I'm trying
        To hold smoke
        I swear it's like dying
        To catch a ghost
        It feels like I'm trying
        To hold smoke
        
        When the army had to hold the line
        Well you were nowhere near the front
        Before the kids could tell the dog "goodbye",
        Well you were loading up your gun
        I wanna know I've left the great divide
        I wanna know what I've become
        You think that no one else is lonesome
        You think that you're the only one
        
        It feels like I'm jumping towards a train
        It feels like I'm jumping towards a train
        Well I'm trying to find a way
        
        It feels like I'm jumping towards a train
        It feels like I'm jumping towards a train
        Well I'm trying to find a way
