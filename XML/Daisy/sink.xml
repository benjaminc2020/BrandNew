    <title>Sink</title>
    <lyrics>
        I don't want to let you go
        But it hurts my hands to hold the rope
        I won't be such an easy mark
        You're no better than they say
        
        And all the candles on the cake
        All set fire to the gate
        Turn the cannons towards the boat
        Men were drowning in the moat
        It was the end of all rowers oars
        
        If you call then I'm coming to get you
        If you call then I'm coming, now
        If you call then I'm coming to get you
        You want to sink, so I'm gonna let you
        
        All I want's some earth and seed
        But only grow the things I need
        But first I must find my way back
        And you go lay down on the track
        
        At first I had an even keel
        But now I'm not sure what is real
        It's taken me this long to learn
        That every dead is ate by worms
        And once they're gone they don't return
        
        If you call then I'm coming to get you
        If you call then I'm coming, now
        If you call then I'm coming to get you
        You want to sink, so I'm gonna let you
        
        I'm coming to get you
        If you call then I'm coming to get you
        If you call then I'm coming to get you
        You want to sink, so I'm gonna let you
        Then the fire snuck into your bedroom
        Now I'm falling asleep to forget you
        
        How darkly the dark hand met his end
        He was withered and boney, exposed for a phoney
        But we heed the last words that he penned
        Haste to disgrace the traitor. Do not wait til later
        I don't think that you've got to pretend
        I see God in birds and Satan in long words
        But I know what you need in a friend
        So now when I leave you, I hope I won't see you
        
        How darkly the dark hand met his end
        He was withered and boney, exposed for a phoney
        But we heed the last words that he penned
        Haste to disgrace the traitor. Do not wait til later
        
        If you call then I'm coming to get you
        If you call then I'm coming, now
        If you call then I'm coming to get you
        You want to sink, so I'm gonna let you
        Well, I'm coming to get you
        If you call then I'm coming, now
        If you call then I'm coming to get you
        You want to sink, so I'm gonna let you
        Then the fire snuck into your bedroom
        Now I'm falling asleep to forget you
