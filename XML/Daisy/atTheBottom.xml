        <intro>
            <line> Wait</line>
            <line> I watched you throw out your bouquet</line>
            <line> Now i think about you everyday</line>
            <line> I'm alone now in my bed</line>
        </intro>


        <verse n="1">
            <line> And there's a lake</line>
            <line> And <title>at the bottom</title> you'll find all my friends</line>
            <line> They don't swim cause they're all dead</line>
            <line> We never are what we intend, or invent</line>


            <line> 'Cause I make little lies and then I pull them apart</line>
            <line> Think something dark's living down in my heart</line>
            <line> And if I wanted to die before I got old</line>
            <line> I should've started some years ago digging that hole</line>
        </verse>


        <chorus>
            <line> Well, I carry this box to the proper place</line>
            <line> And when I lower it down I let you fade away</line>
            <line> I hope that you would do this for me</line>
            <line> Well, I'd serve you drugs on a silver plate</line>
            <line> If I thought it would help you get away</line>
            <line> I hope that you would do this for me</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse n="2">
            <line> A deer that a hunter shot in the heart</line>
            <line> Some dogs that got hit by cars</line>
            <line> All came to spill their guts</line>


            <line> And we spoke</line>
            <line> About the <ref type="rel">Father, Son, and Holy Ghost</ref></line>
            <line> And which <ref type="rel">psalms</ref> we had loved the most</line>
            <line> And then we all turned to <ref type="rel">dirt and dust</ref></line>


            <line> Some men die under the mountain just looking for gold</line>
            <line> Some die looking for a hand to hold</line>
        </verse>


        <chorus>
            <line> Well, I carry this box to its proper place</line>
            <line> And when I lower it down I let you fade away</line>
            <line> I hope that you would do this for me</line>
            <line> Well, I'd serve you drugs on a silver plate</line>
            <line> If I thought it would help you get away</line>
            <line> I hope that you would do this for me</line>
        </chorus>


        <verse n="3">
            <line> I stole bricks from the dam almost every day</line>
            <line> Now I'm drowning in the flood I've made</line>
            <line> Who'll explain myself to me on the other side</line>
            <line> I'm gonna want some answers when I die.</line>
        </verse>


        <chorus>
            <line> Well, I carry this box to the proper place</line>
            <line> And when I lower it down</line>
            <line> I let you fade away</line>
            <line> I hope that you would do this for me</line>
            <line> Well, I'd serve you drugs on a silver plate</line>
