    <lyrics>
        Wait
        I watched you throw out your bouquet
        Now i think about you everyday
        I'm alone now in my bed
        
        And there's a lake
        And at the bottom you'll find all my friends
        They don't swim cause they're all dead
        We never are what we intend, or invent
        
        'Cause I make little lies and then I pull them apart
        Think something dark's living down in my heart
        And if I wanted to die before I got old
        I should've started some years ago digging that hole
        
        Well, I carry this box to the proper place
        And when I lower it down I let you fade away
        I hope that you would do this for me
        Well, I'd serve you drugs on a silver plate
        If I thought it would help you get away
        I hope that you would do this for me
        
        A deer that a hunter shot in the heart
        Some dogs that got hit by cars
        All came to spill their guts
        
        And we spoke
        About the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
        And which psalms we had loved the most
        And then we all turned to dirt and dust
        
        Some men die under the mountain just looking for gold
        Some die looking for a hand to hold
        
        Well, I carry this box to its proper place
        And when I lower it down I let you fade away
        I hope that you would do this for me
        Well, I'd serve you drugs on a silver plate
        If I thought it would help you get away
        I hope that you would do this for me
        
        I stole bricks from the dam almost every day
        Now I'm drowning in the flood I've made
        Who'll explain myself to me on the other side
        I'm gonna want some answers when I die.
        
        Well, I carry this box to the proper place
        And when I lower it down
        I let you fade away
        I hope that you would do this for me
        Well, I'd serve you drugs on a silver plate
        If I thought it would help you get away
        I hope that you would do this for me
