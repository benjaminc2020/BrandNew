    <lyrics>
        "Far away from any road,
        Roams my heart in solitude,
        Where no passer-by can see,
        On life's highway, God, with Thee,
        
        Knowing when all else doth fail,
        Thy compassion shall prevail.
        Father, with Thee let me be,
        On life's highway, God, with Thee."
        
        We need vices (oh),
        We need vices (oh),
        Where's all my hope and my marriage license,
        (where's my head?)
        
        Those days are dead
        (forgive me)
        Those days are dead
        (forgive me)
        Those days are dead
        (forgive me)
        We need vices at fifty thousand degrees
        
        She said goodbye to the ground
        She said goodbye to the ground
        She said goodbye to the ground
        And jumped
        
        I got creative (oh no),
        To try to kill the major,
        Where is my trigger?
        My mind eraser
        (we sing that so subtle...)
        
        And that forest burned
        (you see smoke...)
        That forest burned
        (a halo...)
        That forest burned
        (a halo...)
        We need ten years, everyone, so we can return
        
        She said goodbye to the ground
        She said goodbye to the ground
        She said goodbye to the ground
        She said goodbye to the ground
        She said goodbye to the ground
        And jumped
        
        We need vices (oh),
        We need vices (oh),
        We have neither the plans nor the disguises
        
        'Cause those days are dead
        (forgive me)
        'Cause those days are dead
        (forgive me)
        'Cause those days are dead
        (forgive me)
        We need vices to wave to the good old days
        
        She said goodbye to the ground
        She said goodbye to the ground
        She said goodbye to the ground
        And jumped
