        [Recording:]
        And we sing this morning
        that wonderful and grand old message.
        I don't know about you but I never get tired of it
        Number 99: Just As I Am.
        
        I'm a mountain that has been moved
        I'm a river that is all dried up
        I'm an ocean nothing floats on
        I'm a sky that nothing wants to fly in
        I'm a sun that doesn't burn hot
        I'm a moon that never shows it's face
        I'm a mouth that doesn't smile
        I'm a word that no one ever wants to say.
        
        [Child Speaking:]
        I don't wanna be,
        He wasn't finding anybody when he was on the shelf
        I saw him in my dream
        
        I'm a mountain that has been moved
        I'm a fugitive that has no legs to run
        I'm a preacher with no pulpit
        Spewing a sermon that goes on and on and on.
        
        Well if we take all these things
        and we bury them fast
        And we'll pray that they turn into seeds,
        to roots and then grass
        It'd be all right, it's all right,
        it'd be easier that way.
        Or if the sky opened up and started pouring rain
        Like he knew it was time
        to start things over again
        It'd be all right, it's all right,
        it'd be easier that way.
        
        Well if we take all these things

        It'd be all right, it's all right,
        it'd be easier that way
        Or if the sky opened up and started pouring rain
        Like he knew it was time
        to start things over again
        It'd be all right, it's all right,
