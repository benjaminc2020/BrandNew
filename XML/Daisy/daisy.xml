            <line>And we sing this morning</line>
            <line>that wonderful and grand old message.</line>

        <verse n="1">
            <line>I'm a mountain that has been moved</line>
            <line>I'm a river that is all dried up</line>
            <line>I'm an ocean nothing floats on</line>
            <line>I'm a sky that nothing wants to fly in</line>
            <line>I'm a sun that doesn't burn hot</line>
            <line>I'm a moon that never shows it's face</line>
            <line>I'm a mouth that doesn't smile</line>
            <line>I'm a word that no one ever wants to say.</line>

            <line>Well if we take all these things</line>
            <line>and we bury them fast</line>
            <line>And we'll pray that they turn into seeds,</line>
            <line>to roots and then grass</line>
            <line>It'd be all right, it's all right,</line>
            <line>it'd be easier that way.</line>
            <line>Or if the sky opened up and started pouring rain</line>
            <line>Like he knew it was time</line>
            <line>to start things over again</line>
            <line>It'd be all right, it's all right,</line>
