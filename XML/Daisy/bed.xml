    <lyrics>
        My head is lead I don't ever want to go to bed
        Your hair is on fire
        You snuff the blaze turn to vapor then you float away
        We got into a bad fight
        Laid her on the bed [x7]
        
        My eyes are lungs, I'm a prophet and I speak in tongues
        I know how you'll die
        Your sister groans, an usurper to the holy throne
        To me she is just a dead spy
        
        Laid her on the bed [x3]
        Lie to all your friends [x4]
        
        I don't know what you feel like
        Ambushed on the road, stole your gold, you're a rose and you're laughing now
        Everything that I own starts to pile up
        Like bones make the walls of a prison
        
        Laid her on the bed [x3]
        
        I don't ever want to go to bed
        He stay out for the fight
        The champ goes down like a clown in the second round
        I wish we'd had a better goodbye
        Lie to all your friends [x7]
