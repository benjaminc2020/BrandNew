    <lyrics>
        Stones in your eyes,
        Stones in your eyes,
        Stones in your eyes,
        Stones in your mouth,
        Stones in your ears,
        Stones in your mind,
        Stones in your eyes,
        Stones in your eyes,
        
        Living in a jar, think the lids the sky,
        You're hoping for a savior on your cross outside.
        Stars are just a million little fireflies,
        The sun is just a hole; it's the light outside
        
        The chariots shall rage in the streets
        
        No one save me tonight
        Take a try, but leave a light
        Somewhere safe but I know
        Where your going
        Is it safe tonight?
        
        Holding out for rest but on the seventh day,
        I've created nothing and I'm wide awake,
        So can I tie my key to your electric kite?
        The rooster crowed twice and you kissed me goodnight.
        
        There's too many saviors on my cross again,
        I know I'm never going to be a perfect man.
        Everyone's an oyster with their grain of sand,
        I love you most in song now it has to end.
        
        No one save me tonight
        Take a try, but leave a light
        Somewhere safe but I know
        Where your going
        Is it safe tonight?
        
        Stones in your eyes,
        Stones in your eyes,
        Stones in your eyes,
        Stones in your eyes,
        Stones in your eyes,
        Stones in your eyes,
        I'll run a million miles if you win first prize.
        
        No one save me tonight
        Take a try, but leave a light
        Somewhere safe but I know
        Where your going
        Is it safe tonight?
