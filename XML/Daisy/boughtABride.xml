    <lyrics>
        <verse n="1">
            <line>Trees will make a forest</line>
            <line>Trees will make a bow</line>
            <line>These are all the harder</line>
            <line>Words you have to know</line>
            <line>If everyone's a structure</line>
            <line>Where their own savior sits</line>
            <line>Then I'm a little red house</line>
            <line>And no one's living in it</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>Cars are little blood cells</line>
            <line>We are oxygen</line>
            <line>City is the airways</line>
            <line>Suburbs appendages</line>
            <line>She was feeling lonely</line>
            <line>So you let her hide</line>
            <line>Rented out a family</line>
            <line>We bought a bride</line>
            <line>Bought a bride</line>
            <line>Bought a bride</line>
            <line>Bought a bride</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse n="2">
            <line>Little cities names labeled along the map</line>
            <line>They tied her up and laid her on the train tracks</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>Where are all the seedlings</line>
            <line>We grew from violence</line>
            <line>Down in Jersey lumber</line>
            <line>Stealing prosthetic limbs</line>
            <line>Should have been a soldier</line>
            <line>I could have fought and died</line>
            <line>There's no revolution</line>
            <line>So I bought a bride</line>
            <line>Bought a bride</line>
            <line>Bought a bride</line>
            <line>Bought a bride</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse n="3">
            <line>Coming down the alley while the horns play "Taps"</line>
            <line>They tied her up and laid her on the train tracks</line>
            <line>Somehow I always knew when everything was unsaid</line>
            <line>Go and buy a hammer never sing again</line>
        </verse>
