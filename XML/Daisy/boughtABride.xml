    <title>Bought A Bride</title>
    <lyrics>
        Trees will make a forest
        Trees will make a bow
        These are all the harder
        Words you have to know
        If everyone's a structure
        Where their own savior sits
        Then I'm a little red house
        And no one's living in it
        
        Cars are little blood cells
        We are oxygen
        City is the airways
        Suburbs appendages
        She was feeling lonely
        So you let her hide
        Rented out a family
        We bought a bride
        Bought a bride
        Bought a bride
        Bought a bride
        
        Little cities names labeled along the map
        They tied her up and laid her on the train tracks
        
        Where are all the seedlings
        We grew from violence
        Down in Jersey lumber
        Stealing prosthetic limbs
        Should have been a soldier
        I could have fought and died
        There's no revolution
        So I bought a bride
        Bought a bride
        Bought a bride
        Bought a bride
        
        Coming down the alley while the horns play "Taps"
        They tied her up and laid her on the train tracks
        
        Somehow I always knew when everything was unsaid
        Go and buy a hammer never sing again
