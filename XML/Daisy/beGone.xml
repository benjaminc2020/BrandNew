    <lyrics>
        It's getting hard to stay up
        I think I can hear God calling my name
        He'll try to make my heart break
        But I was told you'd call me tonight
        They're calling my name
        They won't slow the car down
        I'm scared that I will keep it for my own
        The one that is calling my name is telling "come down"
        They're calling my name...
        They're calling my name...
        Calling my name...
