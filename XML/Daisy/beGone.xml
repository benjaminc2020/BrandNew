        <line>It's getting hard to stay up</line>
        <line>I think I can hear God calling my name</line>
        <line>He'll try to make my heart break</line>
        <line>But I was told you'd call me tonight</line>
        <line>They're calling my name</line>
        <line>They won't slow the car down</line>
        <line>I'm scared that I will keep it for my own</line>
        <line>The one that is calling my name is telling "come down"</line>
        <line>They're calling my name...</line>
        <line>They're calling my name...</line>
        <line>Calling my name...</line>
