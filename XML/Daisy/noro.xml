    <lyrics>
        Little light lead us through the night
        And if we die burn down the forest
        Chariots, carry us
        Distances we don't care to walk
        
        I'm on my way to hell
        I'm on my way to hell
        
        Why doesn't anyone in Noro sleep?
        Are they all just scared of their dreams?
        When they lay their heads down at night,
        What are they haunted by?
        Why won't anyone just close their eyes?
        Could it hurt them to rest for a while?
        Do they need their friend to be a lover,
        Or their lover to be a friend?
        
        (Because)
        I'm on my way to hell
        (Well I've tried, god knows that I've tried)
        I'm on my way to hell
        (One time, two time, three time, again)
        
        Sitting duck
        Running out of luck
        And our car's stuck on a train crossing
        
        How are we ever gonna know peace
        How will I ever see your light through the trees
        I wanna burn down everything we begun
        I wanna kill and eat my young
        
        (Because)
        I'm on my way to hell
        (Well I've tried, god knows that I've tried)
        I'm on my way to hell
        (One time, two time, three time, again)
        I'm on my way to hell
        (Well I've tried, god knows that I've tried)
        I'm on my way to hell
        (One time, two time, three time, again)
        
        I'm on my way to hell [x4]
