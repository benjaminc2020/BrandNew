        <verse n="1">
            <line>Little light lead us through the night</line>
            <line>And if we die burn down the forest</line>
            <line>Chariots, carry us</line>
            <line>Distances we don't care to walk</line>
        </verse>

        <interlude>
            <line>I'm on my way to hell</line>
            <line>I'm on my way to hell</line>
        </interlude>

        <verse n="2">
            <line>Why doesn't anyone in Noro sleep?</line>
            <line>Are they all just scared of their dreams?</line>
            <line>When they lay their heads down at night,</line>
            <line>What are they haunted by?</line>
            <line>Why won't anyone just close their eyes?</line>
            <line>Could it hurt them to rest for a while?</line>
            <line>Do they need their friend to be a lover,</line>
            <line>Or their lover to be a friend?</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>(Because)</line>
            <line>I'm on my way to hell</line>
            <line>(Well I've tried, god knows that I've tried)</line>
            <line>I'm on my way to hell</line>
            <line>(One time, two time, three time, again)</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse n="3">
            <line>Sitting duck</line>
            <line>Running out of luck</line>
            <line>And our car's stuck on a train crossing</line>

            <line>How are we ever gonna know peace</line>
            <line>How will I ever see your light through the trees</line>
            <line>I wanna burn down everything we begun</line>
            <line>I wanna kill and eat my young</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>(Because)</line>
            <line>I'm on my way to hell</line>
            <line>(Well I've tried, god knows that I've tried)</line>
            <line>I'm on my way to hell</line>
            <line>(One time, two time, three time, again)</line>
            <line>I'm on my way to hell</line>
            <line>(Well I've tried, god knows that I've tried)</line>
