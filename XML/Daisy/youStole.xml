    <title>You Stole</title>
    <lyrics>
        Last night they said the fire had spread
        And we said our prayers
        And now the flames are burning me in my bed,
        But I just don't care
        We all go to sleep in the same place
        And in the morning hope that we're all the same
        Just sit around like broke down cars in the lot Waiting for repairs
        
        There you go
        There it goes...
        
        Well I wish that I was as good as you
        Caring and trusting
        And I wish that my condition was new but I'm old and rusting
        So we just hurry up only to wait
        Add to the list of all the places we hate
        And I pretend like I got something to say
        But I've got nothing
        
        Now I know that you stole
        Yeah you stole
        From the cradles they were rocked in
        You took the first words that they spoke
        Yeah you stole
        Yeah you stole
        So if I'm a liar and you're a thief
        At least we both know where the other one sleeps
        So let's end this tonight
        
        Now I know that you stole
        Yeah, you stole
        From the cradles they were rocked in
        You took the first words that they spoke
        Yeah you stole
        Yeah you stole
        
        So if I'm a liar and you're a thief
        At least we both know where the other one sleeps
        So let's end this tonight
