    <title>You Stole</title>
    <lyrics>
        <verse n="1">
            <line>Last night they said the fire had spread</line>
            <line>And we said our prayers</line>
            <line>And now the flames are burning me in my bed,</line>
            <line>But I just don't care</line>
            <line>We all go to sleep in the same place</line>
            <line>And in the morning hope that we're all the same</line>
            <line>Just sit around like broke down cars in the lot Waiting for repairs</line>
        </verse>

        <interlude>
            <line>There you go</line>
            <line>There it goes...</line>
        </interlude>

        <verse n="2">
            <line>Well I wish that I was as good as you</line>
            <line>Caring and trusting</line>
            <line>And I wish that my condition was new but I'm old and rusting</line>
            <line>So we just hurry up only to wait</line>
            <line>Add to the list of all the places we hate</line>
            <line>And I pretend like I got something to say</line>
            <line>But I've got nothing</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>Now I know that you stole</line>
            <line>Yeah you stole</line>
            <line>From the cradles they were rocked in</line>
            <line>You took the first words that they spoke</line>
            <line>Yeah you stole</line>
            <line>Yeah you stole</line>
            <line>So if I'm a liar and you're a thief</line>
            <line>At least we both know where the other one sleeps</line>
            <line>So let's end this tonight</line>
        </chorus>
