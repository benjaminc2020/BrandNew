    <lyrics>
        [Love Spit Love cover]
        
        Well I talk
        Too much
        To myself
        And I turn my back on my faith
        It's like glass
        When we Break
        I wish no one in my place
        
        And I've seen
        You don't need their seeds
        When the cut goes in deep
        And I'm lost in sleep
        
        I can't stay
        In this place
        I can't stand
        When the room turns round
        On my fate
        You give no guarantees
        There's no promise
        I can keep
        
        I can't stand
        I can't see my way
        I feel blind
        On my feet
        I can't stay too long
        Am I wrong?
        
        Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
        Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
        Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
        Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
        Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
        Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
        
        I'm so tired
        Of my mood
        And sleep comes
        With a knife, fork and a spoon
        You're so pale
        In your face
        You let life
        Get in your way
        
        And I've seen
        You don't need their seeds
        When the cut goes in deep
        And I'm lost in sleep
        Am I wrong?
        
        Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
        Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
        Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
        Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
