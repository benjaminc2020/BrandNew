    <lyrics>
        We'll take it easy, tigers in a cage
        We're pacing on our pads, and waiting
        For the time to come in reverie
        Our lazy bones ache for our dowry
        
        You can't hold on to the thrill
        So I hope you find your will to follow through
        What we invented, I am now ending
        Hold on to who you love
        We are dry and blown like dust since we were young
        What we invented, I am now ending
        
        The closest thing we had to royalty
        A chance to break our parents' pattern
        We chose to keep our teenage tragedy
        In lieu of their romantic palette
        Play tender like a newborn baby would
        Play tender 'til the night is over
        I'm leaving you to nurture cherished wounds
        And care for it just like your lover, yeah
        
        You can't hold on to the thrill
        So I hope you find your will to follow through
        What we invented, I am now ending
        Hold on to who you love
        We are dry and blown like dust since we were young
        What we invented, I am now ending
        
        You can't hold on to the thrill
        So I hope you find your will to follow through
        What we invented, I am now ending
        Hold on to who you love
        We are dry and blown like dust since we were young
        The morning's over, the day is in full swing
        
        I know you're busy, but please won't you come visit me?
        You are an aimless ghost, you haunt your bag of bones
        The wolf messed with your vision, he is sitting in your kitchen while you sleep tonight
        He will eat your young and you will act surprised
        
        You can't hold on to the thrill
        So I hope you find your will to follow through
        What we invented, I am now ending
        Hold on to who you love
        We are dry and blown like dust since we were young
        What we invented, I am now ending
        
        You can't hold on to the thrill
        So I hope you find your will to follow through
        What we invented, I am now ending
        Hold on to who you love
        We are dry and blown like dust since we were young
        The morning's over, the day is in full swing
