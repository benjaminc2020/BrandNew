    <lyrics>
        We were doomed from the start, as starters are.
        Why am I doing this?
        Digging my own grave. Though it's shallow,
        I would lie in it.
        We're down in the basement, in the dark,
        after we crash your car.
        Hoping fast that my arrow hits the mark,
        so you know who we are.
        
        Please keep the reporters at bay.
        This is a matter of life and death,
        but I deal with things like this everyday.
        Please keep the reporters at bay.
        You never do what I tell you to.
        You never do what I say.
        We've been hurting a long time. Trying hard for this.
        We all have sizeable scars. We got it.
        You'd break it all apart. We got it.
        We can make it work like this, like this, like this...
        
        Yes we are a bullet in the heart
        and the message sent.
        Always dragging your feet over sand
        and over hot cement.
        Make a list of your favorites. Write it down.
        Make it legible.
        A problem we're always facing. You never rest.
        You either push or pull.
        
        Please keep the crowd under control.
        This is a matter of life and
        death and we're not prepared. I just want you to know.
        Please keep the crowd under control.
        This is the weight of my conscience.
        This is an all time low.
        We've been hurting a long time. Trying hard for this.
        We all have sizeable scars. We got it.
        You'd break it all apart. We got it.
        We can make it work like this, like this, like this...
        
        I see my baby. She's starry eyed.
        I hear my bones break all the time.
        I see my baby. She's starry eyed.
        She follows. Don't call me unkind.
        [x2]
        
        We've been hurting a long time. Trying hard for this.
        We all have sizeable scars. We got it.
        You'd break it all apart. We got it.
        We can make it work like this, like this, like this...
