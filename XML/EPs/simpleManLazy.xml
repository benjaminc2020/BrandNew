    <title>Simple Man / Lazy</title>
    <lyrics>
        I wish I was a simple man
        Always quiet
        Always have something planned
        On my own
        
        Tried to be honest to understand
        I'm often jealous
        But not as sinful as them
        Back in my own home
        
        Quietly going crazy
        Born tired and lazy and blue
        
        I wish I was a simple man
        Trying hard
        Doing the best that I can
        On my own
        If I had a second chance
        I'd go back and mend
        All the things that I could have
        Back at home
        
        Quietly going crazy
        Born tired and lazy and blue
        I'm growing old and less sprite
        This time around I won't save me or you
        
        Quietly going crazy
        Born tired and lazy and blue
        I'm growing old and less sprite
        This time around I won't save me or you
