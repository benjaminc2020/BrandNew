    <lyrics>
        So the air's getting colder
        And the news keeps us scared
        We still wrestle this summer
        From the bones of our tired and blistered hands
        'Cause tonight we got drinks
        And just a couple of friends
        And the girl that my brother likes is finally talking to him
        And his chest is all swelled like he's proud and happy
        Like he's got a great idea
        Like he's making a memory
        Wake up and come out to the car
        There's an east swell coming
        And it's howling off shore and we'll be
        Lying like lions out in the sands
        But I'll be dead before you put a gun in my brother's hands
        So we make jokes back at home
        And we lighten the mood
        But growing up my parents saw
        What sending a kid to fight can really do
        Now with the war I can tell they're a little shook up
        'Cause just a few mother's sons will never really be enough
        Not 'til half of our names are etched out in a wall
        And the other half ruined from the things we saw
        Wake up and come out to the car
        There's an east swell coming
        And it's howling off shore and we'll be
        Lying like lions out in the sands
        But I'll be dead before you put a gun in my brother's hands
        Wake up and come out to the car
        There's an east swell coming
        And it's howling off shore and we'll be
        Lying like lions out in the sands
        But I'll be dead before you put a gun in my brother's hands
