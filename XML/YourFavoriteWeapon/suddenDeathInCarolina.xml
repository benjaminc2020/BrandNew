        <verse n="1">
            <line>Last night I swallowed <ref img="alcohol">liquor</ref> and <ref img="fire">a
                    lighter</ref> and this <ref img="time">morning</ref> I threw up fire.</line>
            <line>But it's nothing new. I've been <ref type="idiom">piecing it together</ref> and
                it's got something to do</line>
            <line>with every look thrown like a knife across a crowded room.</line>
            <line>Every slow and quiet <ref img="car">car ride</ref> I spent <ref img="alcohol"
                    >drinking</ref> in the <ref img="car">backseat</ref>.</line>
            <line>Every stupid melody to every stupid song.</line>
            <line>And every stupid word that everybody's <ref type="idiom">hanging on</ref>.</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>What difference does this difference in age make?</line>
            <line>I know how it ends... she'll <ref img="death">kill</ref> me quick.</line>
            <line>So call 911.</line>
            <line>I'm already <ref img="death">dead</ref> but someone should be caught</line>
            <line>and held responsible for this bloody mess.</line>

            <line><ref img="time">Last night</ref> I fell asleep next to a liar and I woke up with a

            <line>And it's all that I remember from a <ref img="time">night</ref> spent lying on my
                back</line>
            <line>with a view of a stone white ceiling and the back of your head.</line>
            <line>This dark and quiet <ref img="bed">bed</ref> felt like the middle of
                nowhere.</line>
            <line>We beat each other up just like we always do.</line>
            <line>When I'm talking to myself I'd always rather be talking to you.</line>

            <line>They hung her from the bridge on <ref img="time">Monday</ref>.</line>
            <line>The gathering turned into a mob out on the lawn.</line>
