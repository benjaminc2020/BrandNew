    <lyrics>
        <line>I cashed in all my chips tonight and combed my hair till it was just right.</line>
        <line>Cause I've been thinking about you and me girl, and we got something going on.</line>
        <line>You told me you can't wait to see me and then you didn't bother to even show
            up.</line>
        <line>This whole situation is incredibly typical, I should have seen it all along.</line>
        <line>It's girls like you that make my think I'm better</line>
        <line>off at home on a Saturday night with all my doors locked up tight.</line>
        <line>I won't be thinking about you baby.</line>
        <line>You call me on the phone, and you don't even want to talk.</line>
        <line>You're staring at me from across the room then turn your back when I walk up.</line>
        <line>We got inches away, and I never even got close.</line>
        <line>So leave your lipstick at home.</line>
        <line>Don't pick up the phone.</line>
        <line>Don't bother to look in my direction.</line>
        <line>I should have seen it all along.</line>
        <line>It's girls like you that make me</line>
        <line>think I'm better off home on a Saturday night with all my doors locked up
            tight.</line>
        <line>I won't be thinking about you, baby.</line>
        <line>Forget everything you think you know about me.</line>
        <line>This isn't highschool</line>
        <line>this isn't highschool</line>
        <line>this isn't highschool</line>
        <line>this isn't highschool</line>
        <line>this isn't highschool...</line>
