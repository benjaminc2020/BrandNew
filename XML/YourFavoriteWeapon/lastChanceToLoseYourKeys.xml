    <title>Last Chance To Lose Your Keys</title>
    <lyrics>
        I cashed in all my chips tonight and combed my hair till it was just right.
        Cause I've been thinking about you and me girl, and we got something going on.
        You told me you can't wait to see me and then you didn't bother to even show up.
        This whole situation is incredibly typical, I should have seen it all along.
        It's girls like you that make my think I'm better
        off at home on a Saturday night with all my doors locked up tight.
        I won't be thinking about you baby.
        You call me on the phone, and you don't even want to talk.
        You're staring at me from across the room then turn your back when I walk up.
        We got inches away, and I never even got close.
        So leave your lipstick at home.
        Don't pick up the phone.
        Don't bother to look in my direction.
        I should have seen it all along.
        It's girls like you that make me
        think I'm better off home on a Saturday night with all my doors locked up tight.
        I won't be thinking about you, baby.
        Forget everything you think you know about me.
        This isn't highschool
        this isn't highschool
        this isn't highschool
        this isn't highschool
        this isn't highschool...
