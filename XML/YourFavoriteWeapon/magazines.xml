    <lyrics>
        <intro><verse n="1">Laetitia, you destroy me,
        so I can't see why I feel so lonely
        when you and me could be forever
        perfectly perfect together. I know.
        Broken down in my dead bedroom,
        stuttering to pictures of you.
        I know that you can always see me.
        I saw you staring through my TV last night.</verse></intro>
        
       <chorus> So I'll leave the door open all night,
        in case you decide you want to stop on by.
        Because you got to know who's been singing that song on the radio.
        The one that goes...(the one that goes...)</chorus>
        
        <verse n="2">My friends all call me crazy cause I
        stay up late anticipating,
        and planning for the day I sweep you
        off your feet, I'd never leave you alone.
        Laetitia, you got my hand shaking,
        I'm begging you oh baby please stop breaking
        my heart because I got the feeling
        that you and I will never really get it on.</verse>
        
        <chorus>So I'll leave the door open all night,
        in case you decide you want to stop on by.
        Because you got to know who's been singing that song on the radio.
        The one that goes...(the one that goes...)</chorus>
        
       <chorus> Girl, come to me.
        The only broken-hearted loser you'll ever need,
        or I'll be left alone forever with my magazines.</chorus>
        
        <chorus>Come to me.
        The only broken-hearted loser you'll ever need,
        or I'll be left alone forever with my magazines.</chorus>
        
        <verse n="3">Girl, come to me.
        The only broken-hearted loser you'll ever need,
        or I'll be left alone forever with my magazines.</verse>
        
        <verse n="4">Girl, come to me.
        The only broken-hearted loser you'll ever need,
        or I'll be left alone foreverâ€¦</verse>
        
        <outro>Laetitia, you destroy me,
        so I can see why I feel so lonely
        when you and me could be forever
        perfectly perfect together. I know.</outro>
