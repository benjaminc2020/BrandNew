    <lyrics>
        <line>So, it's sad this doesn't <ref type="idiom">suit you</ref> now.</line>
        <line>And me fresh out of rope...</line>
        <line>Please ignore this lisp, I never meant to sound like this.</line>
        <line>So take me and break me and make me strong like you.</line>
        <line>I'll be <ref img="time">forever</ref> grateful to this and you.</line>
        <line>It's only you, beautiful.</line>
        <line>Or I don't want anyone.</line>
        <line>If I can choose it's only you.</line>
        <line>Fix me to a chain around your neck and wear me like a nickel.</line>
        <line>Even <ref type="rel">new wine served in old skins</ref> cheapens the taste.</line>
        <line>I shot the pilot, now I'm begging you to fly this for me.</line>
        <line>I'm here for you to use, broken and bruised.</line>
        <line>Do you understand?</line>
        <line>It's only you, beautiful.</line>
        <line>Or don't want anyone.</line>
        <line>If I can choose, it's only you.</line>
        <line>But how could I miscalculate... perfect eyes will have perfect aim.</line>
        <line>If I can choose, it's only you.</line>
        <line>“We're wrecking” and I'm dry like a drum...when you scream</line>
        <line>so fine I'll leave... we're spent... we've got <ref img="time">time</ref> and trials...</line>
        <line>measured in miles... we slave for <ref img="time">days (and weeks).</ref></line>
        <line>It's only you, beautiful.</line>
        <line>Or I don't want anyone.</line>
        <line>If I can choose. It's only you.</line>
        <line>But how could I miscalculate... perfect lies from a perfect dame.</line>
        <line>If I can choose... it's only you.</line>
