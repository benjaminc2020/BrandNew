        <verse n="1">
            <line>I got a twenty-dollar bill that says no one's ever seen you without makeup.</line>
            <line>You're always made up.</line>
            <line>And I'm sick of your tattoos,</line>
            <line>and the way you always criticize the <ref type="popCulture">Smiths... and Morrissey</ref>.</line>
            <line>And I know that you're a sucker for anything acoustic.</line>
            <line>But when I say let's keep in touch,</line>
            <line>I really mean I wish that you'd grow up.</line>
            <line>This is the first song for your mixtape.</line>
            <line>It's short just like your temper,</line>
            <line>but somewhat golden like the <ref img="time">afternoons</ref> we used to spend before you got too
                cool...</line>
