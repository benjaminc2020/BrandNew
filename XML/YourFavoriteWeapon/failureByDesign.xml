    <title>Failure By Design</title>
    <lyrics>
        Watch you on the ones and twos
        Through a window in a well lit room
        Become a recluse
        And I blame myself because I make things hard
        And you're just trying to help
        And when I wake up you're the first to call
        This is one more late night basement song
        And I'm so sore
        My voice has gone to hell
        And this is one more sleepless night because
        
        We don't believe in filler, baby
        If I could I'd sit this out
        
        (This is over when I say it's over)
        This is a lesson in procrastination
        I kill myself because I'm so frustrated
        And every single second that I put it off
        Means another lonely night I gotta race the clock
        (I ignore it and it ignores me too)
        Let's say we go and crash your car
        And every time I leave you go and lock the door
        So I walk myself picking at a chip on my shoulder
        I'm another day late and one year older
        It's failure by design
        
        And we just want sleep
        But this night is hell
        I'm sick and sunk and I blame myself
        Because I make things hard and you're just trying to help
        I got no gas (no gas)
        I'm winding out my gears
        This is one more day on the verge of tears
        And now my head hurts (head hurts)
        And my health is a joke
        Now I gotta stop because the headphones broke
        
        We don't believe in filler, baby
        If I could I'd sit this out
        
        (This is over when I say it's over)
        This is a lesson in procrastination
        I kill myself because I'm so frustrated
        And every single second that I put it off
        Means another lonely night I gotta race the clock
        (I ignore it and it ignores me too)
        Let's say we go and crash your car
        And every time I leave you go and lock the door
        And I walk myself picking at a chip on my shoulder
        I'm another day late and one year older
        It's failure by design
        
        I'm out of everything
        No one sleeps till we get this shit out on the shelves
        It's late, I'm faltering
        But this time I got nothing to say besides
        Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
        Doo doo doo, doo doo doo (Baby, I'm better than this)
        Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
        Doo doo doo, doo doo doo (Baby, I'm better than this)
        Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
        Doo doo doo, doo doo doo (Baby, I'm better than this)
        Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
        Nothing to say besides
        
        (This is over when I say it's over)
        This is a lesson in procrastination
        I kill myself because I'm so frustrated
        And every single second that I put it off
        Means another lonely night I gotta race the clock
        (I ignore it and it ignores me too)
        What say we go and crash your car?
        And every time I leave you go and lock the door
        So I walk myself picking at a chip on my shoulder
        I'm another day late and one year older
        I'm a failure by design
