        <intro><line>Whatever poison's in this bottle will leave me broken sore and stiff.</line>
            <line>But it's the genie at the bottom who I'm sucking at. He owes me one last
                wish.</line>
            <line>So here's a present to let you know I still exist.</line>
            <line>I hope the next boy that you kiss has something terribly contagious on his
                lips.</line></intro>
        <verse n="1">
            <line>But I got a plan (I got a plan)</line>
            <line>Drink (drift) for <ref type="rel">forty days and forty nights</ref>.</line>
            <line>A sip for every <ref img="time">second-hand tick</ref>.</line>
            <line>And for every time you fed me the line, "you mean so much to me...".</line>
            <line>I'm without you.</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>So tell all the English boys you meet, about the American boy back in the
                states.</line>
            <line>The American boy you used to date.</line>
            <line>Who would do anything you say.</line>

            <line>(And even if her plane)</line>
            <line>And even if her plane crashes tonight she'll find some way to disappoint
                me,</line>
            <line>by not <ref img="fire">burning</ref> in the wreckage, or <ref img="water">drowning at the bottom of the sea</ref>.</line>
            <line>"<ref type="bandMember">Jess</ref>, I still taste you, thus reserve my right to hate you."</line>
            <line>And all this empty space that you create does nothing for my flawless sense of
                style.</line>

            <line>It's <ref img="time">8:45</ref> (it's 8:45). The weather is getting better by the <ref img="time">hour</ref>.</line>

            <line>And if you ever said you miss me then don't say you never lied.</line>
