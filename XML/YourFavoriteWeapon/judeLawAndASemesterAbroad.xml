    <lyrics>
        <intro><line>Whatever poison's in this bottle will leave me broken sore and stiff.</line>
            <line>But it's the genie at the bottom who I'm sucking at. He owes me one last
                wish.</line>
            <line>So here's a present to let you know I still exist.</line>
            <line>I hope the next boy that you kiss has something terribly contagious on his
                lips.</line></intro>
        <verse n="1">
            <line>But I got a plan (I got a plan)</line>
            <line>Drink (drift) for forty days and forty nights.</line>
            <line>A sip for every second-hand tick.</line>
            <line>And for every time you fed me the line, "you mean so much to me...".</line>
            <line>I'm without you.</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>So tell all the English boys you meet, about the American boy back in the
                states.</line>
            <line>The American boy you used to date.</line>
            <line>Who would do anything you say.</line>

        <verse n="2">
            <line>(And even if her plane)</line>
            <line>And even if her plane crashes tonight she'll find some way to disappoint
                me,</line>
            <line>by not burning in the wreckage, or drowning at the bottom of the sea.</line>
            <line>"Jess, I still taste you, thus reserve my right to hate you."</line>
            <line>And all this empty space that you create does nothing for my flawless sense of
                style.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse n="3">
            <line>It's 8:45 (it's 8:45). The weather is getting better by the hour.</line>
            <line>(Rains all the time) I hope it rains there all the time.</line>
            <line>And if you ever said you miss me then don't say you never lied.</line>
            <line>I'm without you.</line>
