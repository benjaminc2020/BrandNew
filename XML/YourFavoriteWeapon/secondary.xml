        <verse n="1">
            <line>And it comes down to you.</line>
            <line>Never and ever.</line>
            <line>Wrecked his day with looks and flirts</line>
            <line>and midnight in your shortest skirts.</line>
        </verse>
        <preChorus>
            <line>Past the point of trying, I'm a dying breed. </line>
            <line>Thank her for reminding me of all the things I've done completely wrong.</line>
        </preChorus>
        <chorus>
            <line>Stop these looks and letters.</line>
            <line>This isn't for the better.</line>
            <line>You put me down...</line>
            <line>It's for the worse, you're not my girl.</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse n="2">
            <line>Stop the circulation to my legs and break my bones. </line>
            <line>Dateless and late, I'm better by myself at home.</line>
        </verse>
        <preChorus>
            <line>Past the point of trying, and I'm dying here.</line>
            <line>Secondary. She laughs at every word I know came out completely wrong.</line>
        </preChorus>
        <chorus>
            <line>Stop these looks and letters.</line>
            <line>This isn't for the better.</line>
            <line>You put me down...</line>
            <line>It's for the worse, you're not my girl.</line>

        <bridge>
            <line>And it's my last semester...</line>
            <line>And brothers always come first.</line>
            <line>It's my last semester (It's my last semester)</line>
            <line>At least until next winter. (At least until next winter}</line>
            <line>But I'm sure that I'll be over this by then.</line>
        </bridge>
        <preChorus>
            <line>Past the point of trying, I'm a dying breed.</line>
            <line>Thank her for reminding me of all the things I've done completely wrong.</line>

        <outro>
            <line>Better scenes... I wish she'd seen me.</line>
            <line>Better off if I just let it be.</line>
            <line>Better pretend it don't matter.</line>
            <line>I'd be better off if I could have her.</line>
            <line>Better days since the day I met her.</line>
            <line>I better hope she got my letters.</line>
            <line>Better off in two year stretches...</line>
