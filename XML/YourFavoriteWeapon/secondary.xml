        <verse n="1">
            <line>And it <ref type="idiom">comes down to you</ref>.</line>
            <line>Never and ever.</line>
            <line>Wrecked his <ref img="time">day</ref> with looks and flirts</line>
            <line>and <ref img="time">midnight</ref> in your shortest skirts.</line>
        </verse>
        <preChorus>
            <line>Past the point of trying, I'm a dying breed. </line>
            <line>Thank her for reminding me of all the things I've done completely wrong.</line>
        </preChorus>

            <line>Stop the circulation to my legs and break my bones. </line>

        </verse>
        <preChorus>
            <line>Past the point of trying, and I'm dying here.</line>

            <line>It's my last <ref img="school">semester</ref> (It's my last <ref img="school">semester</ref>)</line>
            <line>At least until next <ref img="season">winter</ref>. (At least until next winter}</line>
            <line>But I'm sure that I'll be over this by then.</line>

            <line>I better hope she got my letters.</line>
            <line>Better off in two <ref img="time">year</ref> stretches...</line>
