        <verse n="1">
            <line>Passed out on the <ref img="car">overpass</ref></line>
            <line><ref type="idiom"><ref type="rel"><ref img="time">Sunday</ref> best</ref></ref> and broken glass</line>
            <line>Broken down from the bikes and <ref img="alcohol">bars</ref></line>
            <line>Suspended like spirits over <ref img="car">speeding cars</ref></line>
            <line>You and me were kings over the <ref img="car">parkway</ref> tonight</line>
            <line>And <ref img="time">tonight</ref> will go on <ref img="time">forever</ref> while we</line>
            <line>walk around this town like we own the streets</line>
            <line>and stay awake through summer like we own the heat</line>
            <line>Singing "everybody wake up (wake up) it's <ref img="time">time</ref> to get down"</line>
            <line>(everybody, everybody wake up its <ref img="time">time</ref> to get down)</line>
            <line>And when I <ref img="alcohol">pass the bottle</ref> back to Pete</line>
            <line>on the <ref img="car">overpass</ref> tonight, I bet we laugh</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>I'm gonna stay eighteen <ref img="time">forever</ref> (cut me open)</line>
            <line>So we can stay like this <ref img="time">forever</ref> (sun poisoned)</line>
            <line>And we'll never miss a party (this offer...)</line>
            <line>cause we keep them going constantly (...stands forever)</line>
            <line>And we'll never have to listen (new haircut)</line>
            <line>to anyone about anything (new bracelet)</line>
            <line>cause it's all been done and it's all been said (eyeliner)</line>
            <line>we're the coolest kids and we take what we can get</line>

            <line>The <ref type="rel">hell</ref> out of this town</line>
            <line>Find some conversation</line>
            <line>The <ref img="car">low fuel lights</ref> been on for <ref img="time">days</ref></line>
            <line>It doesn't mean anything</line>
            <line>I've got another 500, 'nother 500 miles</line>
            <line>before we shut this <ref img="car">engine</ref> down,</line>
            <line>we shut it down</line>
