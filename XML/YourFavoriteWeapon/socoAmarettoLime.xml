    <lyrics>
        Passed out on the overpass
        Sunday best and broken glass
        Broken down from the bikes and bars
        Suspended like spirits over speeding cars
        You and me were kings over the parkway tonight
        And tonight will go on forever while we
        walk around this town like we own the streets
        and stay awake through summer like we own the heat
        Singing "everybody wake up (wake up) it's time to get down"
        (everybody, everybody wake up its time to get down)
        And when I pass the bottle back to Pete
        on the overpass tonight, I bet we laugh
        
        I'm gonna stay eighteen forever (cut me open)
        So we can stay like this forever (sun poisoned)
        And we'll never miss a party (this offer...)
        cause we keep them going constantly (...stands forever)
        And we'll never have to listen (new haircut)
        to anyone about anything (new bracelet)
        cause it's all been done and it's all been said (eyeliner)
        we're the coolest kids and we take what we can get
        
        The hell out of this town
        Find some conversation
        The low fuel lights been on for days
        It doesn't mean anything
        I've got another 500, 'nother 500 miles
        before we shut this engine down,
        we shut it down
        
        I'm gonna stay eighteen forever (cut me open)
        So we can stay like this forever (sun poisoned)
        And we'll never miss a party (this offer...)
        cause we keep them going constantly (...stands forever)
        And we'll never have to listen (new haircut)
        to anyone about anything (new bracelet)
        cause it's all been done and it's all been said (eyeliner)
        we're the coolest kids and we take what we can get (wait forever)
        
        (you're just jealous cause I'm young and in love)
        Eighteen forever (first kisses)
        (your stomach's filled up but you're starved for conversation)
        So we can stay like this forever (new stitches)
        (you're spending all your nights growing old in your bed)
        And we'll never miss a party (collar weekend)
        (and your tearin up your photos cause you wanna forget... it's over)
        cause we keep them going constantly (appearance ticket)
        (you're just jealous cause I'm young and in love)
        And we'll never have to listen (November to...)
        (your stomach's filled up but you're starved for conversation)
        to anyone about anything cause it's all been done (...remember)
        (you're spending all your nights growing old in your bed)
        and it's all been said (nightswimmers)
        (and your tearin up your photos cause you wanna forget... it's over)
        we're the coolest kids and we take what we can get
        
        Just jealous cause we're young and in love
        You're just jealous cause we're young and in love
        You're just jealous cause we're young and in love
        You're just jealous cause we're young and in love
        You're just jealous cause we're young and in love
        You're just jealous... [turntable scratch]
