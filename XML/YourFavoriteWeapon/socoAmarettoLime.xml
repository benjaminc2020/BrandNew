        <verse n="1">
            <line>Passed out on the overpass</line>
            <line>Sunday best and broken glass</line>
            <line>Broken down from the bikes and bars</line>
            <line>Suspended like spirits over speeding cars</line>
            <line>You and me were kings over the parkway tonight</line>
            <line>And tonight will go on forever while we</line>
            <line>walk around this town like we own the streets</line>
            <line>and stay awake through summer like we own the heat</line>
            <line>Singing "everybody wake up (wake up) it's time to get down"</line>
            <line>(everybody, everybody wake up its time to get down)</line>
            <line>And when I pass the bottle back to Pete</line>
            <line>on the overpass tonight, I bet we laugh</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>I'm gonna stay eighteen forever (cut me open)</line>
            <line>So we can stay like this forever (sun poisoned)</line>
            <line>And we'll never miss a party (this offer...)</line>
            <line>cause we keep them going constantly (...stands forever)</line>
            <line>And we'll never have to listen (new haircut)</line>
            <line>to anyone about anything (new bracelet)</line>
            <line>cause it's all been done and it's all been said (eyeliner)</line>
            <line>we're the coolest kids and we take what we can get</line>

            <line>The hell out of this town</line>
            <line>Find some conversation</line>
            <line>The low fuel lights been on for days</line>
            <line>It doesn't mean anything</line>
            <line>I've got another 500, 'nother 500 miles</line>
            <line>before we shut this engine down,</line>
            <line>we shut it down</line>
        </chorus>

        <chorus>
            <line>I'm gonna stay eighteen forever (cut me open)</line>

        <chorus>
            <line>(you're just jealous cause I'm young and in love)</line>
            <line>Eighteen forever (first kisses)</line>
            <line>(your stomach's filled up but you're starved for conversation)</line>
            <line>So we can stay like this forever (new stitches)</line>
            <line>(you're spending all your nights growing old in your bed)</line>
            <line>And we'll never miss a party (collar weekend)</line>
            <line>(and your tearin up your photos cause you wanna forget... it's over)</line>
            <line>cause we keep them going constantly (appearance ticket)</line>
            <line>(you're just jealous cause I'm young and in love)</line>
            <line>And we'll never have to listen (November to...)</line>
