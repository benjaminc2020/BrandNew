        <verse n="1">
            <line>It's funny how your worst enemies always seem to</line>
            <line>turn out to be all of your</line>
            <line>best friend's best friends</line>
            <line>But I folded and I told</line>
            <line>These aren't things I saved to sink you</line>
            <line>but I folded, I told</line>
            <line>So draw or throw and I will explode</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>It's time for you to choose</line>
            <line>the bullet or the chapstick</line>
            <line>And you are far too cute or whatever he said</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse n="2">
            <line>Every time I hear it I am wishing I was great</line>
            <line>I wish her... past tense my best friend</line>
            <line>But I folded and I told</line>
            <line>These aren't things I say to save me</line>
            <line>But I folded, I told</line>
            <line>I hope she's caught in the explosion</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>It's time for you to choose</line>
            <line>the bullet or the chapstick</line>
            <line>And you are far too cute or whatever he said</line>
        </chorus>

        <bridge>
            <line>It's time for you to choose</line>
            <line>It's time for you to choose</line>
            <line>the bullet or the chapstick</line>
            <line>This is me in his room</line>
            <line>This is me in his room</line>
            <line>This is me in his room</line>
        </bridge>

        <bridge>
            <line>Red, gold, I told</line>
            <line>We don't play fair</line>
            <line>Red, gold, I told</line>
            <line>We never stand too close</line>
        </bridge>

        <verse n="3">
            <line>So I update this almost every single day for you</line>
            <line>I begin to hate you for your face and not just the things you do</line>
            <line>Go tell him how my wrist is sore</line>
            <line>from pulling at your insides all night</line>
            <line>Nothing that you do is new to anything or anyone but you </line>
