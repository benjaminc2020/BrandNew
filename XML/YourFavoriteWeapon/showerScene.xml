    <lyrics>
        It's funny how your worst enemies always seem to
        turn out to be all of your
        best friend's best friends
        But I folded and I told
        These aren't things I saved to sink you
        but I folded, I told
        So draw or throw and I will explode
        
        It's time for you to choose
        the bullet or the chapstick
        And you are far too cute or whatever he said
        
        Every time I hear it I am wishing I was great
        I wish her... past tense my best friend
        But I folded and I told
        These aren't things I say to save me
        But I folded, I told
        I hope she's caught in the explosion
        
        It's time for you to choose
        the bullet or the chapstick
        And you are far too cute or whatever he said
        
        It's time for you to choose
        It's time for you to choose
        the bullet or the chapstick
        This is me in his room
        This is me in his room
        This is me in his room
        
        Red, gold, I told
        We don't play fair
        Red, gold, I told
        We never stand too close
        
        So I update this almost every single day for you
        I begin to hate you for your face and not just the things you do
        Go tell him how my wrist is sore
        from pulling at your insides all night
        Nothing that you do is new to anything or anyone but you
