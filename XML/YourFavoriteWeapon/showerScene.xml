            <line>But I folded and I told</line>
            <line>These aren't things I saved to sink you</line>

            <line>the bullet or the chapstick</line>
            <line>And you are far too cute or whatever he said</line>
        </chorus>

            <line>Every time I hear it I am wishing I was great</line>
            <line>I wish her... past tense my best friend</line>

            <line>These aren't things I say to save me</line>

        <verse n="3">
            <line>So I update this almost every single <ref img="time">day</ref> for you</line>
            <line>I begin to hate you for your face and not just the things you do</line>
            <line>Go tell him how my wrist is sore</line>
            <line>from pulling at your insides <ref img="time">all night</ref></line>
            <line>Nothing that you do is new to anything or anyone but you </line>
