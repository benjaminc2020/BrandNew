    <lyrics>
        Back in school they never taught us what we needed to know,
        like how to deal with despair, or someone breaking your heart.
        For twelve years I've held it all together but a night like this is begging to pull me apart.
        I played it quiet, left you deep in conversation.
        I felt uncool and hung out around the kitchen.
        I remember I kept thinking that I know you never would,
        and now I know I want to kill you like only a best friend could.
        
        Everyone's caught on to everything you do
        Everyone's caught on to.
        
        As if this happening wasn't enough I got to go
        and write a song just to remind myself how bad it sucked.
        Ignore the sun, the cover's over my head.
        I wrote a message on my pillow that says, "Jesse, stay asleep in bed."
        So don't apologize. I hope you choke and die.
        Search your cell for something with which to hang yourself.
        They say you need to pray if you want to go to heaven
        but they don't tell you what to say when your whole life has gone to hell.
        
        Everyone's caught on to everything you do
        Everyone's caught on to
        And everyone's caught on to everything you do (And I can't let you, let me down again.)
        Everyone's caught on to (And I can't let you, let me down again)
        
        So, is that what you call a getaway?
        Tell me what you got away with.
        Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish.
        I've seen more guts in eleven-year-old kids.
        Have another drink and drive yourself home.
        I hope there's ice on all the roads.
        And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt,
        and again when your head goes through the windshield.
        
        And is that what you call tact?
        You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back.
        So let's end this call, and end this conversation.
        and is that what you call a getaway?
        well tell me what you got away with.
        cause you left the frays from the ties you severed
        when you say best friends means friends forever
        
        So, is that what you call a getaway?
        Well tell me what you got away with.
        Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish.
        I've seen more guts in eleven-year-old kids.
        Have another drink and drive yourself home.
        I hope there's ice on all the roads.
        And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt,
        and again when your head goes through the windshield.
        
        Everyone's caught on to everything you do (And I can't let you, let me down again)
        Everyone's caught on to (And I can't let you, let me down again)
        And everyone's caught on to everything you do (And I can't let you, let me down again)
        Everyone's caught on to (And I can't let you, let me down again)
