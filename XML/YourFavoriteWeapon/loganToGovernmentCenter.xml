    <lyrics>
        Consider this a letter that I never sent
        However inconsiderate it seems
        Do you still consider me,
        consider me the boy you laughed with
        or that you learned to live without?... I suck,
        I know I'm late,
        I know you waited
        
        You wouldn't get me on the phone
        And you couldn't make me not alone
        
        My phone bills stacked up by my bedside,
        with your picture, you're looking surprised
        You're what makes New England so great
        My island nights are all spent dying
        Wait for summer to become wrought with lips,
        my wishful thinking
        
        You wouldn't get me on the phone
        And you couldn't make me not alone
        (Yeah you wouldn't get me)
        Yeah you're a blue eyed lightning bolt
        (You wouldn't get me)
        I'm a national phenomenon
        (You wouldn't get me on the phone)
        Nothing's absolutely definite til it's absolutely, definitely gone (definitely gone)
        
        I never thought this day would end (never thought this day would end)
        I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me (close to me)
        So let my hands stray past that boundaries of your back
        to get you breathing (get you breathing)
        And get this started (get this started)
        
        You wouldn't get me, you wouldn't get me
        You wouldn't get me on the phone
        (Yeah, you wouldn't get me)
        Yeah you're a blue eyed lightning bolt
        (You wouldn't get me)
        I'm a national phenomenon
        (You couldn't make me not alone)
        Nothing's absolutely definite til it's gone
