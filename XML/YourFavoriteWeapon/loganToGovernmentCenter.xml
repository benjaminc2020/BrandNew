        <intro><verse n="1">
                <line>Consider this a letter that I never sent</line>
                <line>However inconsiderate it seems</line>
                <line>Do you still consider me,</line>
                <line>consider me the boy you laughed with</line>
                <line>or that you learned to live without?... I suck,</line>
                <line>I know I'm late,</line>
                <line>I know you waited</line>
            </verse></intro>
        <chorus>
            <line>You wouldn't get me on the phone</line>
            <line>And you couldn't make me not alone</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse n="2">
            <line>My phone bills stacked up by my bedside,</line>
            <line>with your picture, you're looking surprised</line>
            <line>You're what makes New England so great</line>
            <line>My island nights are all spent dying</line>
            <line>Wait for summer to become wrought with lips,</line>
            <line>my wishful thinking</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <line>You wouldn't get me on the phone</line>
            <line>And you couldn't make me not alone</line>
            <line>(Yeah you wouldn't get me</line>
            <line>Yeah you're a blue eyed lightning bolt</line>
            <line>(You wouldn't get me)</line>
            <line>I'm a national phenomenon</line>
            <line>(You wouldn't get me on the phone</line>
            <line>Nothing's absolutely definite til it's absolutely, definitely gone (definitely
                gone)</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse n="3">
            <line>I never thought this day would end (never thought this day would end)</line>
            <line>I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me (close to me)</line>
            <line>So let my hands stray past that boundaries of your back</line>
            <line>to get you breathing (get you breathing)</line>
            <line>And get this started (get this started)</line>
        </verse>
        <outro><chorus>
                <line>You wouldn't get me, you wouldn't get me</line>
                <line>You wouldn't get me on the phone</line>
                <line>(Yeah, you wouldn't get me)</line>
