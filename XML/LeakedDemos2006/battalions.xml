    <lyrics>
        Please say you'll come along tonight
        Please sing the words we love
        Don't say that you forgot them
        Don't keep the hand we've come to hold
        I know you want to untie this rope and let it go
        
        Please pose my skeletal remains
        Give them a working pen
        And I will live forever
        Please let them love me though I fade
        
        I know you want to
        I know you want to
        I know you want to run away
        
        We're finding our own tonight
        We're single spies when sorrow comes
        They come on battalions
        We're finding our own tonight
        A little light to keep it on our own battalion
        
        Please keep these sounds from running out
        Please let our steps fall soft
        Keep them from hearing our tongue
        Please let some hope come with the day
        
        I know you want to
        I know you want to
        I know you want to run away
        
        We're finding our own tonight
        We're single spies when sorrow comes
        They come on battalions
        We're finding our own tonight
        A little light to keep it on our own battalion
        
        I know you want to
        I know you want to
        I know you want to run away
        
        And so we watch the time we keep
        And you know that I am swift
        You know that I am quick
        You know that I am fast asleep
        
        We're finding our own tonight
        We're single spies when sorrow comes
        They come on battalions
        We're finding our own tonight
        A little light to keep it on
        Our own battalion
        
        I know you want to
        I know you want to
        I know you want to run away
