    <lyrics>
        Well take it easy, tigers in the cage
        Pacing on our pads, and waiting
        For the time to come in reverie
        Our lazy bones ache for our dowry
        
        Can't hold on to the thrill
        So I hope you find your will to follow through
        What we invented, I am now ending
        Hold on to who you love
        We are tryin' to blow like dust since we were young
        What we invented, I am now ending
        
        The closest thing we had to royalty
        A chance to break our parents' pattern
        You chose to keep your teenage tragedy
        In lieu of their romantic pallet
        Play tender like a new born baby would
        Play tender to the night is over
        I'm leaving you to nurture cherished wounds
        And care for it just like your lover, yeah
        
        Can't hold on to the thrill
        So I hope you find your will to follow through
        What we invented, I am now ending
        Hold on to who you love
        We are tryin' to blow like dust since we were young
        What we invented, I am now ending
        
        Can't hold on to the thrill
        So I hope you find your will to follow through
        What we invented, I am now ending
        Hold on to who you love
        We are tryin' to blow like dust since we were young
        The morning's over, the day is in full swing
