    <lyrics>
        Well I lost my taste for the company of airports and cars
        We flew through the year and
        Avoided the dust and rock
        We stood in the way of the tank till we bored and we stopped
        So never show doubt in your hand
        Till you know what they got
        
        Touch me or don't
        Just let me know
        Where you’ve been
        
        Well drop me a line with a hook and some raw bleeding bait
        (one, two, three, four)
        Well I'm uncaught and still swimming alone in the lake
        (five, six, seven, eight)
        Shimmering under the moon made of anger and hate
        I was the one who was always repeating it
        Shimmering like a penny out of reach in the subway grate
        (Shimmering like a coin kept safe away
        You’ll never listen to anything)
        
        Touch me or don't
        Just let me know
        Where you’ve been
        Leave it alone, I’m sure there’s someone who knows
        Where you’ve been
