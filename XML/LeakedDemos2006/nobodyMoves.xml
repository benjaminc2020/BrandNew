        Nobody Moves    
    </title>
    <lyrics>
        I can barely move
        I can barely see where we're going now
        The road is washed out from the river
        That flooded just north of town
        
        We stick, stick, stick, stick to the plan we laid out
        But we know the saying
        The best, best, best, best plans of both mice and men
        Can go terribly wrong and they probably will
        
        So please - nobody speaks
        Nobody get any smart ideas
        If we don't have any heroics
        We may just get out of here
        And home to your families by dinner time
        Safely and soundly sleeping
        Cause we don't want trouble
        Well take what we came for and
        We'll leave quiet or maybe we will...
        
        Tear you up, take what you love
        And burn it down, burn it down
        
        Nobody moves, nobody moves
        And no one gets hurt
        If nobody opens their mouth
        We have nothing to worry about
        
        We'll keep, keep, keep, keep you alive
        Cause we always need bargaining chips
        (For their lives we will trade you and make your getaway)
        We'll keep, keep, keep, keep you alive 'cause you're pretty
        And we need something to look at while we...
        
        Tear you up, take what you love
        And burn it down, and burn it down
        You swear to build, we swear to come
        And burn it down, and burn it down
        
        Weighing the cost of the love you made
        Measure again, yeah
        Feeling the weight of the bones you break
        Break them again, yeah
        
        Wandering the park
        And sinking our teeth into anyone who'll suffice
        And who can survive my disease
        
        Break all the locks without the combination
        I know where you hid it - I consider it mine
        Went to the crowns without a planning or feeling
        And keep me alert til the next bout of time
        
        Please cut me up, cut me up
        Honey, make me the lover you wanted
        When you were young and asleep
        And I'm fine when you're here
        Find my call from a bottle
        The lover you wanted
        While you waited so long
        
        Weighing the cost of the love you made
        Measure again, yeah
        Feeling the weight of the bones you break
        Break them again, yeah
        
        Weighing the cost of the love you made
        Measure again, yeah
        Feeling the weight of the bones you break
        Break them again, yeah
        
        Weighing the cost of the love you made
        Measure again, yeah
        Feeling the weight of the bones you break
        Break them again, yeah
        
        Weighing the cost of the love you made
        Measure again, yeah
        Feeling the weight of the bones you break
        Break them again, yeah
