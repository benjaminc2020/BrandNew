        Good Man
    </title>
    <lyrics>
        Well I wrote your name and burned it
        See the color of the flame
        And it burned out the whole spectrum
        As if you were everything
        Mine just burned gold
        A normal flame
        I am not anything
        
        And all that I remember the feeling of waking up
        When we were kids, you were the sun to which my eyes would not adjust
        When we were kids, I was a fountain
        You could never drink enough
        Then came all the boys who swept you up play careless with your heart
        Every night there was a new girl sitting beside me in my car
        Something dies when you grow older
        But you do the best you can
        
        I am glad
        I am glad...
        You found a good man
