        Brother's Song
    </title>
    <lyrics>
        So the air's getting colder
        And the news keeps us scared
        I still wrestle this summer
        From the bones of our tired, blistered hands
        Cause tonight we got drinks, just a couple of friends
        And the girl that my brother likes is finally talking to him
        And his chest is all swelled like he's proud and happy
        He's got a great idea, like he's making a memory
        
        Wake up and come out to the car
        There's an East swell coming and its howling off shore
        And we'll be lying like lions out in the sand
        But I'll be dead before you put a gun in my brothers hand
        
        So we make jokes back home
        And we lighten the mood
        But growing up my parents saw
        What sending a kid to fight could really do
        Now with the war, I can tell they're a little shook up
        Just a few mother's sons, will never really be enough
        Not until half of our names are etched out in the wall
        And the other half ruined from the things we saw
        
        Wake up and come out to the car
        There's an East swell coming and its howling off shore
        And we'll be lying like lions out in the sand
        But I'll be dead before you put a gun in my brothers hand
