        1996

    <lyrics>
        She was just 17
        Pious and pretty with a deadly disease
        And the weight of the world on her prosthetic shoulder
        And by the summer of '96
        Her body was cracked like porcelain
        Just like some precious moments collectible
        In a hospital gown and a big bright golden halo...
        
        And so three cheers for my morose and grieving pals
        And now let's hear it for the tears that i've welled up
        We've come too far to have to give it all up now
        We live lives that are rich and blessed
        And we'll burn for how we transgress...
        
        Now i've mastered the art
        Of the open casket prayer and the singing guitar
        And i've found the rewards weren't half what i'd hoped for
        And meanwhile we all feigned hope and mirth
        As her parents went on and lied to her
        All about the success of the surgeries
        And how my ex-girlfriend was now sleeping with her fianc√©
        
        And so three cheers for my morose and grieving pals
        And now let's hear it for the tears that i've welled up
        We've come too far to have to give it all up now
        We live lives that are rich and blessed
        And we'll burn for how we transgress
        
        If there's any justice in heaven
        Then God won't let me in
        He'll lock the gates and take my weekend pass away
        With a sympathetic wave they'll see me off
        Reserve my golden crown while I am cursed to walk the earth for a millenia
        I know I deserve worse but it terrifies me and I can't take it anymore...
        
        And so three cheers for my morose and grieving pals
        And now let's hear it for the tears that i've welled up
        We've come too far to have to give it all up now
        We live lives that are rich and blessed
        And we'll burn for how we transgress
