    <lyrics>
        Losing all my friends, losing them to drinking and to driving
        Losing all my friends, I want 'em back
        Slipping out the back, did you really think we wouldnâ€™t notice?
        Slipping out the back in the pouring rain
        
        Yeah
        Yeah
        
        Leo loved his wife, loved her and was faithful to her always
        Buried both the kids in the summer sun
        Praying for this life
        Huddled in the brig hull with the shipmates
        Praying for this life and I dropped the bomb
        
        Yeah
        Yeah
        Yeah
        Yeah, yeah
        
        Whatcha waiting for? Searching for your brother
        In an empty room across the hall, is he coming back?
        Listening at night, waiting for a son to come up the stairs
        Listening at night, waiting for the sound of the car park
        
        Yeah
        Yeah
        Yeah
        Yeah, yeah
        
        Call him up this summer on the phone
        Need to know what it feels like again
        Summer skin, found another lover
        Tell him straight, call him up again
        I'll call him up again, yeah
        Call him up again
        
        Tying both your shoes and
        Looking past the ocean for the signal
        Waiting for a body in a open box
        They don't send you letters
        They don't telephone you
        They don't send you letters
        But you're waiting for them
        You write him, yeah
        
        Yeah
        Yeah
        Yeah
        Yeah, yeah
        
        Call him up this summer on the phone
        Need to know what it feels like again
        I'll call him up again
        Call him up this summer on the phone
        Need to know what it feels like again
